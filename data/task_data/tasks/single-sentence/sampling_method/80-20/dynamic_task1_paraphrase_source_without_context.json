However, applications from those with strong ties to the county, like armed forces personnel who have relocated, will also be considered. The application process began on Monday.

    "sentence": "RamJam recently launched 'Southern Rail Tycoon' on Thursday, attracting 45,000 players to its satirical gameplay. In this light-hearted game, the objective is to prevent guards from boarding trains. Succeeding in this leads to service cancellations, from which players 'profit' by collecting virtual fares. The game draws its inspiration from the persistent train cancellations experienced over recent months, a result of an ongoing dispute with the RMT union. Players lose when a sufficient number of guards successfully board a train, causing the delayed service to finally depart.\n\nTom Jackson, a developer based in Brighton, shared his personal frustration, recounting how a planned trip to London a month prior was repeatedly delayed and then ultimately cancelled, leading his group to abandon train travel altogether. This frustrating experience prompted Mr. Jackson and his colleagues, Phil Hart and Toby Funnell, to create the game. The 39-year-old developer explained that the game serves a dual purpose: offering a fun distraction for commuters enduring train delays and raising awareness about the available compensation policies. Upon game completion, links are provided to Southern Rail's official compensation page and their Twitter account.\n\nJackson further elaborated that their studio enjoys creating games that are \"reactive\" to current events, demonstrating the \"impact\" news has on individuals. He described the train service as \"an absolute shambles\" and \"incredibly frustrating\".\n\nA spokesperson for Southern Rail countered, stating that cancelling trains actually results in financial losses for them. They expressed efforts to provide the \"best service possible under very difficult circumstances\" and offered a \"sincere apology\".\n\nThe root of the ongoing issue lies in a dispute between the RMT union and GTR concerning the proposed increase in driver-only operated (DOO) services, which would alter the responsibilities of conductors. Due to regular strikes, Southern cancelled 341 daily train services on July 11, citing a need to improve \"reliability.\" Since then, 15 of these services have been reinstated.\n\nThe continuous delays on the line, managed by Govia Thameslink Railway, led to the resignation of Rail Minister Claire Perry last Friday. The new Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, declared on Monday that resolving the strike action was \"top of his priority list\".",

Fortunately, the two occupants of the overturned lorry were uninjured. The vehicle came to rest on its side on the B4299, connecting Trelech and Bryn Iwan, on Tuesday evening shortly before 8 PM GMT.\n\nColin Evans from Carmarthenshire council confirmed that gritting vehicles would continue to be deployed as required.

Evans elaborated that \"Gritting crews will stay on main routes until conditions are deemed safe.

This decision follows the company's failure to convince key lenders to reschedule its debt under a new restructuring plan, leading to a severe cash shortage. Hanjin's shares remain suspended in Seoul, having plummeted by as much as 29% on Tuesday. The world's seventh-largest container line, Hanjin has reported unprofitability in four of the last five years.\n\nSome financial reprieve for Hanjin may come from rival Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM). HMM's shares surged by up to 22% after Korea's financial regulator indicated that the firm might acquire some of Hanjin's assets. Nevertheless, HMM has not been unaffected by the difficulties plaguing the sector, having recently announced its own reorganization strategy.\n\nSouth Korea's shipping and shipbuilding industries are among those most severely impacted by a prolonged global trade downturn. A decline in orders has resulted in overcapacity, suppressed freight rates, and an escalation of debts. Nomura analyst Young Sun Kwon explained that Korean shipping companies have suffered substantial losses primarily because charter rates for leased vessels were fixed at high levels in 2010, while actual shipping rates have subsequently fallen.\n\nThe South Korean government is now preparing to implement a difficult, industry-wide restructuring, which will necessitate significant job cuts. Krystal Tan from Capital Economics stated that this ongoing restructuring is one reason why weak economic growth is anticipated this year and next. She added that the loss of tens of thousands of jobs would certainly negatively affect economic sentiment. However, she believes this number is relatively small when compared to the 26 million people employed in Korea, meaning a large increase in the unemployment rate is unlikely.",

As part of his sentence, Thrower was ordered to complete a 60-day course specifically designed to address sex offending behavior, in addition to a further 30-day rehabilitation program.\n\nProsecutor William Carter explained that the rector was apprehended after a 17-year-old, using a toilet at the Buttermarket shopping centre, heard a sound above him. The teenager observed a hand holding a mobile phone that was filming him over the cubicle partition. He then seized the device, which led directly to Thrower's arrest.\n\nWhen handing down the sentence, Judge Katharine Moore acknowledged Thrower's generally \"well-regarded\" status among those he had assisted, describing him as having been a \"listening ear\" in both \"times of great sadness and some in happier times.\" She stated her perception that his \"persistent behavior over a two-year period\" had consistently been blamed on a decline in his mental health. While acknowledging his dedication to his work, she firmly rejected the notion that his actions were anything but deliberate choices, made repeatedly in public restrooms when he believed he would not be caught.\n\nUpon his arrest, officers discovered three additional videos on his phone from that same day, two of which captured men seemingly unaware their privacy was being invaded.\n\nThrower, whose address is Church Street, Hadleigh, Suffolk, serves as the rector for Hadleigh, Layham, and Shelley parishes. The Diocese of St Edmundsbury in Ipswich has suspended him from all his duties.

She added that since his time at Ashworth Hospital, Mr. Capp has described voices commanding him to kill people with his bare hands.

Dr. Joseph told the jury he believed Mr. Capp understood his actions when he killed his cellmate.\nMr. Thomas's body was discovered in the cell with a plastic bag over his head and approximately 100 stab wounds to the neck inflicted by a ballpoint pen.\nMr. Capp's defence rests on a plea of not guilty to murder due to diminished responsibility.

The 29-year-old Kompany was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi, City’s £32.5m signing from Valencia, after Mario Mandzukic equalised for Juventus. Alvaro Morata then scored the winning goal nine minutes from time.\n\nPellegrini also couldn't start striker Sergio Aguero due to a knee injury sustained during Saturday's win at Crystal Palace. The Argentina international made a seven-minute substitute appearance after City fell behind. Pellegrini explained Aguero was not fit for a full 90 minutes, deeming it too risky to play him extensively due to the potential for re-injury in the same area.\n\nThis defeat highlighted a persistent issue for City, who have yet to win their opening Champions League home game in five group stage attempts. Despite this, Pellegrini remains confident of reaching the last 16. Their next two matches are away trips against Germany’s Borussia Monchengladbach and Spain’s reigning Europa League champions, Sevilla.\n\nPellegrini, who turns 62 on Wednesday, stressed that 15 more points are still available, and qualification depends on their performance and the results of their upcoming matches. He admitted losing at home to a strong side like Juventus was not an ideal start but emphasized that similar situations have occurred previously without preventing their progression.\n\nRaheem Sterling was noted for missing a significant early chance and another when City were 1-0 up. However, Pellegrini downplayed the focus on Sterling, asserting that City had controlled the game. He described it as a \"strange game\" and felt City played better than Juventus, not deserving to lose.

A significant number of drivers paid these fines without questioning their legality. Following a review of PCSO authority in March, it was discovered that some PCSOs, who had joined the force years prior, had not been properly authorised to issue parking tickets from the outset. Police acknowledged in a statement that \"an administrative error rendered the authorisation invalid.\" The force's records, accessible back to 2006, revealed that 16,000 tickets were impacted, leading to a total of £485,000 being paid into the courts. The force also conceded that other fines might have been issued under similar incorrect circumstances up to three years earlier. They confirmed seeking legal counsel on the issue. A spokesperson explained that, after legal assessment, they are confident there are no legal grounds for refunds, which would otherwise use public money. The core reasoning is that drivers had the opportunity to dispute the tickets' validity in court at the time, and penalties were only imposed on those found guilty. By choosing to pay the fine, motorists effectively accepted responsibility for the offence and forfeited their right to challenge it legally. The police confirmed that this \"anomaly\" has since been rectified, and PCSOs now possess the full authority to issue such fines.",

Key issues identified were insufficient staffing and a rise in the use of new psychoactive substances, which contributed to more erratic and aggressive conduct. However, inspectors also observed positive interactions between staff and prisoners, alongside a diverse array of training and educational opportunities. Although safety levels had worsened since 2013, Mr. Clarke characterized the situation as a complex blend of advancements and setbacks. During the July and August inspections, the prison held 770 inmates, significantly exceeding its Certified Normal Accommodation (CNA) capacity of 532, which indicates the number of prisoners that can be safely and humanely housed. Additional positive aspects noted in the report included better progress in rehabilitating inmates post-release. Conversely, some cells were in disrepair, and there was insufficient bedding. The report indicated that despite difficulties, the facility didn't feel unstable, and good staff-prisoner relations persisted. Michael Spurr, head of the National Offender Management Service, stated that even with considerable operational demands, the prison has maintained a constructive system offering ample purposeful activities and effective pre-release support for inmates. In contrast, the Howard League for Penal Reform, a campaign group, depicted it as an \"overcrowded and understaffed facility where drug access is easy, but clean bedding is scarce.\" The recently implemented smoking prohibition was noted as being \"unpopular among certain individuals.\" Frances Crook, the Howard League's chief executive, commented that while \"this inspection report for Cardiff prison is marginally better than other recent prison reports we've reviewed, it still presents significant reasons for concern.\" Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens, in her response, asserted that \"this report plainly highlights major areas of concern for Cardiff prison, adding to the numerous warnings the Prisons Minister has received.

The explosion provoked violent demonstrations in Istanbul, where police deployed water cannons, teargas, and rubber bullets.

Suruc currently hosts numerous refugees who escaped the violence in Kobane. The attack occurred shortly before noon local time (09:00 GMT), injuring approximately one hundred people. Prime Minister Davutoglu stated that preliminary evidence pointed to IS as the perpetrators. Addressing a news conference in Ankara, he affirmed Turkey's ongoing commitment to implement all essential counter-terrorism measures against Islamic State.

Stewart Hosie of the SNP stressed the necessity of \"absolute transparency\" to ensure taxpayers receive the \"best deal.\" He also pointed out the announcement's timing, just a week before a spending review expected to unveil more \"Tory cuts\" that are already severely affecting the public.

While I had hoped to reach a century, I'm still very proud of this performance, which has made it a truly positive day for us.

The key was to face as many deliveries as possible to settle in, and it was a tough contest against their opening bowlers. My focus was on digging deep and maintaining maximum discipline. Batting with Horts (Paul Horton) is beneficial as his experience provides a calming influence, and it's also excellent to bat alongside Mark (Pettini) because he helps you stay balanced.\"\n\nGlamorgan spinner Andrew Salter shared his thoughts with BBC Wales Sport: \"I'm pleased to have taken those two wickets, though it wasn't surprising that there wasn't much spin – one delivery went straight through, and the other, a bit fuller, found some rough.

He added, \"I told him I love what he does,\" praising the striker's assists, movement, and ability to hold up the ball, concluding, \"I like everything he does.\"\n\nMata's departure was due to a strong challenge from Sebastian Saucedo, though he's only expected to miss up to a week of play. Later, Valencia received a red card for a tackle on Saucedo. Referee Allen Chapman initially consulted with Mourinho before finally sending off the Ecuadorian. Mourinho explained the delay: \"The referee asked me to change the players and I didn't because I don't agree with the card.\" The Old Trafford manager further claimed Saucedo had been \"really aggressive with what happened to Mata and some other actions where he was a bit dangerous,\" but dismissed it as \"pre-season so no problem - it's a good experience.\"\n\nUnited's next fixture is against rivals Manchester City in Houston on Friday morning UK time (02:30 BST).\n\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone in Utah commented on the incident, suggesting referee Allen Chapman was compelled to act after Valencia's forceful tackle on Saucedo. Chapman, notable as the first video assistant referee to make a live decision in a 2016 USL game, reportedly first glanced at Jose Mourinho. After ensuring Saucedo was attended to, he approached the United manager, requesting Valencia be substituted, seemingly cautious about dismissing a player in a friendly. When Mourinho declined, Chapman, \"almost apologetically,\" proceeded to issue the red card to the Ecuadorian.",

Pilot Officer Harold Penketh, a Brighton native, tragically died without bailing out. The aircraft's remains, identified as a Spitfire, were discovered following a geophysical survey of the site. There is an expectation that the salvaged components will eventually be exhibited publicly. Although the precise cause of the crash was never definitively determined, eyewitnesses reported that the Mk 1A Spitfire, serial number X4583, broke away from its formation and plunged nose-first into agricultural land in the village of Holme, located south of Peterborough. An investigation concluded that either the pilot's oxygen supply system failed or the aircraft itself experienced a structural malfunction. The 20-year-old Pilot Officer Penketh apparently made no attempt to deploy his parachute. His body was recovered from the debris and subsequently returned to his relatives. John Bliss, an eyewitness who was a child at the time, recounted that the \"enormous crater\" formed by the Spitfire's impact rapidly filled with water due to the area's high water table. For 75 years, the Spitfire's wreckage lay submerged in its watery resting place. Cranfield University successfully located the crash site in August, using a combination of a geophysical survey and metal detection. The excavation, commencing on Monday and anticipated to last a week, is being overseen by Oxford Archaeology East. The retrieved components, which remain the property of the Ministry of Defence, will undergo cleaning and documentation. Portions of them are slated for public exhibition later this month. Once the excavation concludes, the land will be reinstated as diverse fenland habitats and managed as part of the Great Fen reserve by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Northamptonshire.",

Gareth Davies affirmed that Webb's immediate return was anticipated once he regained fitness, noting that the added competition creates \"a bit of extra pressure\" which he finds enjoyable.\n\nCurrently, England leads Wales by one point at the top of the table, having secured three victories from three games. Both players have a history of impactful performances against England: Webb famously scored a try in Wales' 2015 Six Nations win in Cardiff, while Davies delivered a crucial late try in their 2015 World Cup victory, a tournament Webb missed following surgery. Davies, 25, has accumulated six tries in 12 Wales appearances, in contrast to 27-year-old Webb's five tries in 16 games.\n\nUnder new coach Eddie Jones, England boasts an unblemished record. Wales, meanwhile, rebounded from an opening draw in Ireland to defeat Scotland and France. If England overcomes Wales, they will travel to France on March 19th, aiming for their first Grand Slam since 2003. Conversely, a Welsh triumph on Saturday would position them to win the championship for the third time in five years by simply defeating Italy at home.\n\nDavies admitted that Wales has started some games in this campaign slowly.

That is going to be massive for us.\" He also conveyed confidence in playing on any ground, referencing their strong performances at Twickenham during the World Cup as evidence that it is \"not a place we are scared to go.\"",

Unsurprisingly, Russian executives, once the most optimistic, are now the least so, a shift attributed to sanctions and declining oil prices. In the United Kingdom, there has been a significant increase in apprehension regarding talent availability. The percentage of CEOs in the UK worried about skill shortages jumped from 64% last year to 84% this year, a rate significantly exceeding that in Germany, France, or Spain. This escalating concern is partly attributed to the UK's high employment rates, which reduce the available talent pool, and partly to worries about the quality of the education system. Globally, the primary concerns for chief executives include geopolitical instability, excessive regulation, and cyber security threats. The report, unveiled at the World Economic Forum in Davos, highlighted that apprehension concerning cyber threats has risen more than any other issue since last year, noting that recent attacks on gaming and entertainment networks are expected to further elevate this perceived risk. Dennis Nally, PwC's chairman, commented that CEO confidence has significantly declined in oil-producing countries globally, primarily due to collapsing crude oil prices. He cited Russian CEOs as a prime example, shifting from being the most confident in the prior year's survey to the least confident this year. Nally added that executives in the Middle East, Venezuela, and Nigeria have also experienced a drop in confidence. Furthermore, he observed a noticeable transfer of confidence from emerging markets towards Western economies. For the upcoming year, chief executives identified the United States as their top market for growth, surpassing China for the first time since this question was introduced five years ago. PwC conducted this survey by interviewing over 1,300 chief executives across 77 nations during the last quarter of 2014.",

These fatalities escalated political tensions in Paraguay, subsequently leading to President Fernando Lugo's removal from office by congress.\n\nIn the aftermath, four men were sentenced to 18 to 30 years in prison, with an additional seven individuals (men and women) receiving jail terms of four to six years. Testimony revealed the confrontation took place near Curuguaty, in eastern Paraguay's Canindeyu province. Approximately 250 riot police were dispatched to clear about 70 subsistence farmers from a Campos Morumbi agricultural company property. The farmers had been occupying the land to advocate for agrarian reform.\n\nNotably, the Paraguayan prosecution service failed to investigate the farmers' deaths, and both local and international human rights organizations raised concerns about judicial irregularities throughout the trial. Furthermore, five of the defendants undertook a hunger strike lasting over 30 days.\n\nUnequal land ownership has historically fueled violent conflicts in Paraguay. A 2008 census highlighted this disparity: a mere 2.6% of landowners control 85.5% of the country's land, while 91.4% of small farmers (with holdings under 20 hectares) possess only 6% of agricultural land. Advocates for agrarian reform largely attribute this imbalance to major agricultural conglomerates specializing in soy exports. The Curuguaty incident then served as the catalyst for the opposition Colorado Party to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Lugo, holding him responsible for the fatalities.",

This crucial signal was relayed through a large communication antenna located in Madrid, Spain, part of NASA's global network. Traveling across 4.7 billion kilometers of space, the message required four hours and 25 minutes to reach Earth.\n\nAnticipation grew among scientists and engineers at mission control in Laurel, Maryland, as they awaited the vital telemetry. Consequently, immense joy and relief erupted at 01:52 BST when the signal finally arrived, prompting team members to cheer, embrace, and wave American flags in celebration. \"We are in lock with telemetry from the spacecraft,\" announced Alice Bowman, the mission operations manager, upon confirmation of the signal.

She clarified, \"The expected number of segments on that recorder had been used.

A collision with even minute icy debris at its velocity of 14 km/s would have proven fatal to the spacecraft.

The human rights group Liberty stated that the Attorney General has granted his family permission to apply to the High Court, despite an earlier inquest having recorded a suicide verdict for the 20-year-old soldier.\n\nEarlier this month, a second inquest, examining the death of Private Cheryl James – who also died at Deepcut in 1995 from a single gunshot wound – similarly returned a suicide verdict. Over 100 witnesses testified during the Cheryl James inquiry. In his ruling, Coroner Brian Barker QC strongly criticized Deepcut's welfare provisions, citing compelling evidence of a pervasive sexualized environment.\n\nRepresenting Pte Benton's twin brother Tony and his sister Tracy Lewis, Liberty submitted an application to the Attorney General in July 2015, seeking to nullify the initial July 1995 inquest and demand a new investigation. Liberty stated that since Pte Benton's death, numerous individuals have informed his family and publicly asserted their belief that he, originally from Hastings, East Sussex, endured physical and psychological bullying at the barracks.\n\nMs Lewis expressed being \"overwhelmed and disturbed by all the details of the shameful environment at Deepcut which have finally come to light through the Cheryl James inquest – it is terrible to think of Sean alone there.\" She added that over two decades after their brother's passing, and having recently lost both parents, she and Tony are \"determined to find out what happened to Sean.\"\n\nPte Benton was the initial casualty among four young recruits who succumbed to gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. Liberty highlighted that the first inquest, held merely a month after his death, involved testimony from only six individuals. Crucially, Pte Benton's medical and mental health records were not procured, nor was any evidence gathered or presented regarding his experiences at the barracks. Emma Norton, a lawyer for Liberty, asserted that a proper and independent investigation into Pte Benton's death in 1995 could have spared his family decades of suffering and unresolved questions.",

However, 30-year-old Ruth Percival stated she witnessed no such efforts to revive the child. The inquest was previously suspended in October after fresh medical findings prompted the coroner to refer the matter to prosecuting authorities. By March, the Crown Prosecution Service had concluded there was \"insufficient evidence\" to bring charges against any individual.\n\nDuring the Blackpool Town Hall hearing, it was revealed that Miss Percival, who has special educational needs, sought a pregnancy termination at her GP surgery in August 2014. However, the procedure could not be performed as her pregnancy was too advanced. She admitted to having avoided confronting her pregnancy and to having concealed it from her parents due to fear of their response.\n\nMr. Percival, then the vicar of Holy Trinity CE Church in Freckleton, recounted that on the afternoon of November 25, upon her return from work, she spent time in the downstairs restroom. He described seeing her emerge from the bathroom around 3:30 PM GMT, carrying a towel he thought was soiled with excrement. They went outside to dispose of it when, he stated, \"Jonathan's leg came into view.\" He testified in court, recalling his words to Ruth: \"This is a baby, you can't put a baby in the bin.\" He then stated he laid the infant on the towel on the ground outside and tried to revive him. He described the baby as \"extremely cold, completely lifeless,\" concluding, \"The baby was clearly deceased.\"\n\nMedical evidence presented at the inquest indicated the baby was alive at birth. Miss Percival testified that she believed she saw the baby attempt to breathe, yet also stated, \"I somehow thought I had a miscarriage because, to me, the baby was dead when it emerged from me.\" Both Miss Percival and her father provided testimony indicating Jonathan's umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck.

This caution coincides with the imminent release of findings from a serious case review concerning patient abuse at a private facility located close to Bristol. The BBC Panorama programme brought this abuse to light through covert filming. Eleven individuals have pleaded guilty to charges of neglect and mistreatment linked to the incidents. The South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) commissioned an independent expert to conduct this review.\n\nSince the Panorama broadcast in May of the previous year, Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have received 260 reports from families detailing abuse and neglect within institutional care settings. Their collaborative report, titled 'Out of Sight', documented numerous severe incidents reported by families, encompassing physical and sexual assault, along with excessive use of restraint.\n\nMark Goldring, Mencap's chief executive, expressed concern, stating that without a robust government plan to shut down large care facilities and establish suitable local services for individuals with learning disabilities, another scandal akin to Winterbourne View is highly probable. The charities indicated that hundreds of people with learning disabilities are presently housed in assessment and treatment units similar to Winterbourne View. They highlighted that many of these facilities are situated far from patients' homes, increasing their vulnerability to neglect and abuse.\n\nVivien Cooper, who founded the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, voiced profound worries regarding patient safety and well-being. She elaborated that \"hundreds of individuals with learning disabilities are being placed in distant care institutions, often for years unnecessarily, leaving them susceptible to neglect and abuse.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health affirmed their stance: individuals should, whenever feasible, receive support to reside in their own homes within their local communities. While acknowledging that a limited number of cases may necessitate high-quality assessment and treatment services, potentially involving brief inpatient stays, they stressed that this should not replace excellent community-based care. The spokesperson underlined the critical importance of properly commissioning and regularly reviewing all services, ensuring they are not employed as permanent solutions.\n\nSubsequent to the BBC investigation, twenty-four patients were moved from the Castlebeck-operated Winterbourne View hospital, located near Hambrook.

They shared their profound grief, stating that after a two-week struggle for survival, their \"beloved and irreplaceable Andreea – wonderful daughter, sister, partner, dedicated friend and the most unique and life loving person you can imagine – was cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way.\" They added, \"She will always be remembered as our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts.\"\n\nThe family also expressed immense gratitude to the medical team for their \"never-ending dedication,\" stating they were \"deeply touched and eternally grateful\" and that their \"kindness and empathy are beyond compare.\" They concluded by saying, \"There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and emptiness that is left in our hearts.\"\n\nMr. Burnaz, who himself sustained a broken foot during the assault, recently returned to Westminster Bridge to place a single white rose in remembrance. According to Romania's UK ambassador, Dan Mihalache, who spoke to the BBC, the couple were in London for Mr. Burnaz's birthday, and he had intended to propose. Mihalache further explained that it is believed Masood's vehicle struck Mr. Burnaz after mounting the pavement, subsequently forcing Ms. Cristea into the River Thames.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan conveyed his deep sorrow over Andreea Cristea's passing, tweeting that \"Londoners hold her & her loved ones in our thoughts today.\"\n\nThe attack also claimed the lives of Aysha Frade, 44, a London sixth-form college employee; US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah; and Leslie Rhodes, 75, a retired window cleaner from south London. Additionally, PC Keith Palmer, a father of two, was fatally stabbed outside Parliament.\n\nA \"service of hope\" was held at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday, where relatives of the victims were joined by members of the Royal Family. Ms. Cristea's family has requested that funds initially donated for her recovery now be redirected to charity.",

Jacques Rudolph's pursuit of his inaugural Championship century in 2016 was prolonged when he was dismissed for 56, hitting the ball onto his own stumps. Previously, Essex had been dismissed for 319, with Craig Meschede achieving his first five-wicket haul of the Championship season, ending with figures of 5 for 84. The host team confirmed their promotion and clinched the second-tier title by surpassing 250 runs in their first innings, primarily due to captain Ryan ten Doeschate's century; he contributed an additional eight runs to his overnight total before being out for 117. As a bowler, Ten Doeschate (2 for 20) dismissed both Rudolph and Bragg (54) in his opening over. Bragg had just crossed 1,000 Championship runs for the season, and the duo had earlier formed an 89-run partnership for the second wicket. Although Glamorgan suffered a collapse, losing six wickets for only 36 runs, Mark Wallace (75 not out) and Timm van der Gugten (32) played crucial roles in extending their lead beyond 250. Glamorgan batsman Will Bragg commented to BBC Wales Sport: \"A four-day match can fluctuate significantly, but Wally (Mark Wallace) displayed tremendous resilience, placing us in a strong competitive position for the final day. Maintaining consistency throughout a lengthy season is challenging, so reaching 1,000 runs is gratifying. I find my batting to be more consistent when positioned at number three. I am pleased with how I've avoided throwing my wicket away frequently this year. While the team's performance has been disappointing, there are encouraging indications with emerging young talent, providing much to build on for the future.\"",

The Old Bailey trial revealed that the assailant, having dismounted a stolen moped, stabbed Appleton with a 25-inch (63cm) serrated knife. The 17-year-old attacker, whose identity is protected by law due to his age, was acquitted of murder but is scheduled for sentencing on April 21. Jurors heard that Appleton, an Islington college student, was with companions when his attacker dismounted a scooter, produced the weapon, and pursued the group. After tripping and falling, Appleton was repeatedly stabbed. Police confirmed his death resulted from shock and haemorrhage caused by a chest stab wound. The Metropolitan Police has since issued warnings about 'zombie' knives, noting how these decorative blades are being marketed. The force also highlighted that children were present and playing in the park during the incident. As the killer was driven away from the scene, the court was told he yelled \"RP,\" short for Red Pitch, signifying a rival gang to one in Nightingale Park. The 17-year-old alleged getaway driver was also acquitted of murder, and another 17-year-old boy was found not guilty of conspiring to inflict grievous bodily harm. Following the machete attack, the assailant escaped to Bristol, attempting to fly to Malaga, Spain, but was apprehended upon his return to London, where he sought to evade capture. The killer's defence claimed he had been attacked while trying to retrieve his stolen bicycle from another boy. The court also heard of his previous conviction for blade possession, having been caught with a lock-knife in a McDonald's restaurant a year prior to the killing. Prosecutor Simon Denison QC lamented Appleton's death as yet \"another tragic waste of a young life\" lost to knife violence. After the conviction, Det Ch Insp Chris Jones emphasized that \"there can be absolutely no excuse for young people to carry such dreadful weapons on London's streets,\" highlighting how this case again demonstrates the dire repercussions.",

Among these, two nominations acknowledge Northern Ireland-based production crew members. Ronan Hill, a prior Emmy winner in 2012, is once again nominated for outstanding sound mixing in a drama, and Carla Stronge for outstanding casting in a drama.\n\nSince its inception in 2010, Northern Ireland Screen has invested £12.45 million into the series. This investment is estimated to have resulted in £110.7 million being spent on goods and services within the Northern Ireland economy. Between 2010 and 2014, Game of Thrones contributed an annual £21m to £23m to Northern Ireland's economy. These figures have undergone auditing. For the 2014-15 period, when Game of Thrones series five was filmed, NI Screen invested £1.6m, generating an estimated £22m in return.\n\nThe production of Game of Thrones takes place at Titanic Studios in Belfast and various other sites throughout Northern Ireland. During the series' production, numerous local businesses offer services, and several filming locations have evolved into popular tourist destinations. Damian Carr, representing Game of Thrones Tours, noted that enthusiasts from across the globe travel to visit the filming sites. He specified, \"We've welcomed visitors from North and South America, various parts of Asia including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, as well as throughout Europe.

While the Farc commander's identity has not yet been publicly disclosed, Colombian media anticipate it will be revealed shortly. The rebel group largely finances itself through cocaine production and trafficking. During their investigations, a total of four tonnes of cocaine were confiscated. One of the most substantial seizures occurred overnight on 25-26 August last year, when the Spanish navy intercepted a sailboat headed for the Italian coast, discovering 856kg of cocaine on board.

This operation marked the first of its kind sanctioned by President Donald Trump. The US military initially reported that Navy Seal William \"Ryan\" Owens, 36, was killed and three others injured. However, the US Central Command (Centcom) subsequently stated that children might also be among the fatalities. According to the US military, several Apache helicopters participated in the mission, which resulted in the deaths of 14 militants, including three al-Qaeda leaders. White House spokesman Sean Spicer acknowledged to journalists that it is challenging to deem an operation a \"complete success\" when lives are lost or individuals are injured.

Earlier that Thursday, Reprieve confirmed that a newborn was among the ten children who perished in the assault. The group further cited local accounts indicating that a heavily pregnant woman was shot in the abdomen during the raid, subsequently giving birth to an injured infant boy who tragically passed away. Shortly after the incident, images depicting deceased children began circulating on social media. Earlier in the week, Pentagon spokesman Capt.

    "sentence": "During a crucial rugby match in Italy, Treviso's scrum-half Senioli gestured and smiled at Scott Williams, a Wales international for Scarlets, as he sprinted towards the try line. What seemed like a straightforward score turned into a costly mistake; Williams made Senioli regret his premature celebration by tackling him before he could cross the line. This incident highlights a recurring theme: Henry Senioli isn't the only athlete whose showboating has backfired.\n\nAustralian cyclist Simon Clarke, for instance, mistakenly thought he'd won a race in Italy and began celebrating by raising his arms. However, rival Giovanni Visconti quickly informed him that Davide Formolo had actually finished 22 seconds earlier.\n\nIn football, David Dunn's attempt at a 'rabona' – a complex skill where a player kicks the ball by wrapping one foot behind the other – went disastrously wrong. In front of a packed stadium, his misexecution led to an embarrassing fall.\n\nFinally, French steeplechaser Mahiedine Mekhissi-Benabbad was disqualified and stripped of his European Championship gold medal. He had removed his shirt in celebration with only one hurdle remaining, but a protest from the Spanish team led to his disqualification from the competition.",

    "sentence": "A study published in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing reveals a rising inclination among individuals under 25 to receive anti-wrinkle injections. However, the findings indicate that such \"frozen faces\" might impede young people's ability to fully develop emotional expression. A prominent UK plastic surgery association deems the cosmetic use of Botox in teenagers to be \"morally wrong.\" Botox, and similar neurotoxins, function by temporarily immobilizing muscles in the upper facial region, thereby diminishing wrinkles that appear during frowning.\n\nHelen Collier, the nurse practitioner who conducted this research, attributes young people's aspiration for an \"inexpressive frozen face\" to the influence of reality television and celebrity culture. She highlights the widely recognized psychological concept of the facial feedback hypothesis, which posits that adolescents acquire social interaction skills by imitating others' facial expressions. Collier states that \"our capacity as human beings to exhibit a broad spectrum of emotions is highly reliant on facial expressions.\" She adds that \"emotions like empathy and sympathy are vital for our survival and for developing into self-assured, communicative adults.\" Nevertheless, she cautions that an increasing number of young individuals with \"blank-faced\" appearances might impair their capability to accurately express feelings. She warns, \"Eliminating these expressions could impede their emotional and social maturation.\"\n\nThe study advocates for medical professionals to employ assessment instruments to determine if there are clear clinical justifications for administering Botox. While various assessment scales exist, evaluating factors such as skin thickness, sun damage, and wrinkle depth, experts caution that certain Botox clinics prioritize financial profit over patient well-being. Ms. Collier encourages therapists to devote time to enhancing young people's self-confidence instead of resorting to injections. She further states that \"although the majority of the toxin's effects are temporary, studies indicate that muscles may not fully recover from the injections.\" She stresses, \"It is crucial to comprehend the repercussions of initiating treatments at too young an age.\"\n\nDr. Michael Lewis, a psychology researcher at Cardiff University, explains that \"the expressions we form on our faces influence the emotions we experience.\" He elaborates, \"We smile due to happiness, yet smiling also generates happiness.\" He concludes that \"medications like Botox inhibit a patient's ability to create specific expressions, potentially impacting our natural process of learning to feel emotions.\" Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, asserts that \"administering Botox to teenagers for cosmetic reasons is ethically indefensible and something no responsible practitioner would undertake.\" He warns, \"This practice can only intensify body image concerns during a sensitive developmental period.\" Ms. Collier's findings are scheduled to be presented at the Clinical Cosmetic and Reconstructive Expo in October.",

His management team announced on Manilow's Facebook page that his hospitalization was due to complications from an operation he underwent on Monday. As a result, his next immediate tour dates have been postponed. An updated Facebook post indicated that Manilow has been ordered to avoid talking, singing, or rapping for the next 48 hours. However, those with tickets for the affected shows can use them for the rescheduled performances. The original Facebook statement advised ticket holders to keep their existing tickets for redemption on the new dates. It remains uncertain if Manilow will be able to attend Monday evening's Grammy Awards as scheduled. The New York-born artist, who rose to prominence in the 1970s, enjoys a global fanbase and is widely recognized for hits like \"Mandy\" and \"Copacabana.\" He has faced various health challenges throughout his career, including needing ongoing dental treatment after a benign tumor ruptured in his mouth in 1986.

A pleased Manley conveyed to BBC Radio Wales that he had initially considered par to be a respectable outcome for his first attempt. He concluded his round impressively, scoring an eagle three on the par-five 17th and a birdie on the final hole. Manley remarked that ending the round a couple of strokes under par felt 'great'. This strong finish marked a significant recovery from a nervous beginning, where he lost a stroke on the first hole after his opening drive at one of golf's major tournaments landed in the rough. He described feeling extremely anxious on the first tee, admitting he was 'shaking a little bit' due to the 'horrific' weather. He also mentioned difficulties warming up and a lack of rhythm while wearing his waterproof gear. Manley confessed it was likely the 'most nervous' he had ever been for a tee shot, but expressed optimism about understanding what to anticipate for the next day, hinting at a 'better game plan'. Manley, a professional golfer since 2003 and the sole Welsh competitor at Royal Birkdale, enjoyed considerable support from spectators. He noted the presence of friends from his local golf club, Mountain Ash, and his family, making his good score particularly satisfying for them. He admitted the achievement hadn't fully 'sunk in' yet, suggesting it might become real once he watched some golf later that evening, but confirmed he felt 'pretty chuffed'. Ranked 520th globally, Manley is scheduled to begin his second round on Friday at 11:47 BST. Despite his strong start, he is not adjusting his objectives for the week. He emphasized the need to 'plot your way around the course' due to the demanding links, stating he wouldn't allow his mind to 'wander'.",

    "sentence": "A dagger, part of a pair, was uncovered in 1925 by British archaeologist Howard Carter, tucked within the funerary linens of the young pharaoh Tutankhamun. The pristine, uncorroded iron blade's source remained a puzzle for researchers, as iron metallurgy was uncommon in ancient Egypt. Tutankhamun's mummification occurred over 3,300 years ago. A collaborative study by Italian and Egyptian researchers, published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, utilized a non-destructive X-ray method to verify the iron's makeup without causing harm. Daniela Comelli, the study's lead author, stated that \"a significant nickel content unequivocally points to meteoritic iron.\" The team proposed that the combined levels of iron, nickel, and cobalt \"strongly suggest an extraterrestrial origin\" for the metal. By comparing the dagger's composition to known meteorites found within 2,000 km of Egypt's Red Sea coast, they identified one specific meteorite – which struck 150 miles (240 km) west of Alexandria – that exhibited comparable nickel and cobalt concentrations. According to the researchers, ancient Egyptians highly valued meteoritic iron, frequently using it for crafting exquisite ornamental or ceremonial items. Their findings indicate that Egyptians in the 13th century BCE already recognized that these unusual iron fragments descended from the heavens, a realization that predated Western understanding by over two millennia. The blade's superior craftsmanship, especially when contrasted with simpler meteoritic iron artifacts, \"implies a remarkable proficiency in ironworking during Tutankhamun's reign,\" the team noted. This ornate dagger, boasting a decorated gold handle and a gold sheath adorned with a floral lily design on one face and a feather pattern on the other, is presently exhibited at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.",

    "sentence": "Parliament has, for the first time, formally endorsed the commencement of the UK's departure from the EU by March's end following a vote by MPs. The government's chief whip appeared visibly pleased after the night's proceedings. This ministerial concession was, however, strategically astute; it secured Labour's support for the Article 50 activation timeline with only a nebulous pledge of a future plan, potentially as insubstantial as a brief scribble.\n\nHowever, discontent simmers within Labour ranks regarding the handling of the issue, with reports of angry exchanges, suggesting some feel their leadership was outmaneuvered by the government's scheme. Pro-Remain Conservative dissenters remain highly skeptical of the government's underlying motives for providing further details on its Brexit strategy. Though they retreated today, their challenge is far from over.\n\nYet, beyond these immediate political maneuvers and the whip's evident satisfaction, the past 24 hours have underscored two crucial realities. Firstly, the vote's outcome indicates that very few MPs intend to outright obstruct Brexit or impede the process. While they will undoubtedly press the government for greater specificity and seek to modify any eventual proposals reaching the Commons, potentially causing disruption or delays, halting the departure entirely is not the objective for most.\n\nSecondly, it's equally apparent that Prime Minister Theresa May lacks a stable majority on EU matters. Once her detailed plans are finally presented to Parliament, she will almost certainly be compelled to make concessions. This explains the government's strenuous efforts in the Supreme Court to prevent parliamentary intervention before complex negotiations in Brussels even commence.",
