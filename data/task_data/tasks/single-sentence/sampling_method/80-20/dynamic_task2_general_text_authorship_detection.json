The county 's Police and Crime Commissioner , Marc Jones , said the advert had attracted a phenomenal response from high-calibre individuals. He highlighted that the policy of limiting applications to those with a recent connection to Lincolnshire was a deliberate strategy to recruit officers who genuinely understand and are invested in their local communities. \"It's crucial that our officers not only reflect the diverse population of Lincolnshire but also possess a deep understanding of its unique challenges and characteristics,\" Mr Jones explained. \"Officers who live here are intrinsically motivated to make Lincolnshire a safer place. They know the streets, the people, and the specific issues that matter most to our residents.\"\n\nThis proactive measure by Lincolnshire Police aims to foster stronger community ties and enhance local policing effectiveness. The residency requirement ensures that new recruits have an established connection to the area, which can lead to greater trust and more effective problem-solving within neighborhoods. While Chief Constable Neil Rhodes retired some years ago, the sentiment of officers being embedded within their communities, as he often advocated, remains a core tenet for Lincolnshire Police. The force believes this local approach will significantly benefit public confidence and visible policing across the entire county. The recruitment drive is a cornerstone of the Police and Crime Plan, designed to deliver a dedicated, locally-rooted police service for Lincolnshire for years to come.",

    "sentence": "RamJam uploaded Southern Rail Tycoon on Thursday , and so far 45,000 people have played the tongue - in - cheek game . The aim is to stop guards from boarding trains , which leads to services being cancelled as profits are collected from passengers . It was inspired by months of cancellations due to an RMT dispute . Once a sufficient number of train guards board on a train and a delayed service eventually departs , the player loses the round, and is presented with a screen showing plummeting profits and irate pixelated commuters storming a virtual London Victoria station. The game, created by Brighton-based indie developer Tom Jackson, under his studio moniker RamJam, has rapidly become a viral sensation. Jackson, a long-time frustrated commuter on the Southern Rail network himself, explained the inspiration behind the satirical hit: 'I spent so many hours delayed on platforms, watching those departure boards mock me, that I just had to channel that frustration into something. It started as a joke among friends, but the more I worked on 'Southern Rail Tycoon', the more I realised how many people could relate to the sheer absurdity of it all.'\n\nThe game’s dark humour resonates deeply with those who have endured the real-life chaos on the network. Players must strategically deploy various humorous obstacles, from ‘broken signal’ alerts to ‘leaf on the line’ incidents, all designed to prevent guards from reaching their designated carriages. The more services cancelled, the higher the player's 'tycoon' score, reflecting their fictional mastery over the beleaguered railway. If too many services depart on time, or if guards successfully board multiple trains, the player's 'profit margin' collapses, leading to a swift game over.\n\nDespite its cynical premise, Tom Jackson insists the game is not meant to be a serious political statement, but rather a cathartic outlet. 'It’s about making light of a difficult situation,' he stated. 'It’s satire. It’s a way for people to laugh at the chaos, rather than just fuming about it. We’ve had messages from people in London, Brighton, and all along the line saying how much they appreciate being able to turn their anger into amusement, even if it’s just for a few minutes.' RamJam is now considering updates to Southern Rail Tycoon, including new scenarios and 'disaster' events, as well as a potential mobile version, cementing its status as a cult classic for exasperated commuters everywhere.",

Shares of Hanjin remain suspended in Seoul after plunging by as much as 29 % on Tuesday . Hanjin , which is also the world seventh-largest container shipping line, said it has filed for court receivership after its banks withdrew support. The South Korean company's move, following Korea Development Bank's (KDB) decision to halt financial aid, deals a severe blow to global trade, potentially leaving billions of dollars worth of goods stranded. This could become the largest container shipping bankruptcy, disrupting supply chains globally before the peak shopping season. Already, U.S. and Chinese ports refuse Hanjin ships entry, and some vessels have been seized by creditors.\n\nThe South Korean government has voiced deep concern, urging domestic rivals like Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) to consider taking over some of Hanjin's routes, vessels, and personnel. Financial regulators in Seoul are coordinating efforts to mitigate economic fallout. Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), itself recently restructured, has expressed readiness to cooperate with government plans to stabilize the market. This might involve acquiring Hanjin’s healthy assets, such as port terminals or select ships, to ensure service continuity. Details are pending court proceedings in Seoul.\n\nCreditors, led by KDB, found Hanjin's self-rescue proposals insufficient by the September 4 deadline, leading to negotiation collapse. This signals Hanjin Shipping's likely end, prompting significant reshuffling in global shipping alliances as other major carriers absorb its market share. The incident highlights severe challenges facing the broader shipping sector, long struggling with overcapacity and weak demand.

Thrower was arrested at a shopping centre in Ipswich in August 2016 . He admitted two counts of voyeurism at a previous hearing and his sentence was suspended for 24 months . Thrower was ordered to complete a 60 - day rehabilitation activity requirement, aimed at addressing his offending behaviour and preventing re-offending. As part of his sentence, he was also made the subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order (SHPO) for five years. This order imposes strict conditions, including restrictions on his use of internet-enabled devices and a prohibition on entering any public lavatories. Furthermore, Thrower was ordered to pay £2,500 in prosecution costs and a victim surcharge. The court heard details of how the Very Reverend Martin Thrower, who had served as the rector of Hadleigh in Suffolk for 15 years, had committed these offences. His reprehensible actions came to light when he was observed acting suspiciously at a shopping centre in Ipswich, specifically in the men's public toilets, leading to his arrest in August 2016. During the sentencing hearing at Norwich Crown Court, the presiding judge highlighted the profound breach of trust involved in Thrower's conduct, given his prominent and respected role within the Church of England and the local Hadleigh community. While acknowledging Thrower's early admission of guilt and expressions of remorse, the judge unequivocally underscored the seriousness of the voyeurism offences and the distress caused to his victims. The court took into account his previous good character and long service to the church as mitigating factors, which were instrumental in the decision to suspend his prison sentence for 24 months, but firmly emphasized the necessity for both punitive measures and active rehabilitation. This high-profile case sent ripples through the Hadleigh community and the wider diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich, raising questions about accountability and the profound impact of such a conviction on a figure once held in high esteem.",

Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Melanie Croy told the jury Mr Capp 's ability to form rational judgement was impaired because of his mental illness . Mr Capp admits killing Mr Thomas but denies murder . Appearing for the prosecution, Mr. John Smith QC, told the jury that while Mr Capp's mental health issues were acknowledged, they did not amount to a defence of diminished responsibility or negate the intent to kill. He argued that the brutal nature of the attack on Mr Thomas, carried out while he was vulnerable and asleep in their shared cell on Wing B, demonstrated a clear intention. Mr Smith highlighted the evidence of pre-meditation, suggesting Mr Capp had planned the assault. Dr Croy, cross-examined by the prosecution, reiterated her assessment that Mr Capp suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, leading to a severely distorted perception of reality. She elaborated on his delusional beliefs, which had intensified in the confined environment of Wing B, particularly in relation to his cellmate, Mr Thomas. She stated that while he understood the physical act of killing, his capacity for moral judgment and rational decision-making was profoundly compromised. Prison officers also described Mr Capp's erratic behaviour in the days leading up to the attack. The defence, led by Ms Sarah Jones, countered that Mr Capp's actions were a direct consequence of his severe mental illness, which had been inadequately managed within the prison system. Ms Jones emphasised Dr Croy's expert opinion, arguing Mr Capp suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning which substantially impaired his ability to understand his conduct, form rational judgment, or exercise self-control. She painted a picture of a young man from Scotland whose untreated condition spiralled out of control, leading to the tragic death of Darren Thomas.

    "sentence": "Media playback is not supported on this device Kompany was instrumental as City took the lead , pressuring Giorgio Chiellini into turning the ball into his own net . However , he sustained a calf injury as the Italians fought back to win 2 - 1 . \" We will have to see how Vincent is on Wednesday , \" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini . \" We will check and see how serious the injury is . \" Kompany , 29 , was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi - City 's £32 million summer signing from Valencia. The Belgium international had been in outstanding form at the start of the season, scoring two goals in four Premier League games and leading a defence that had not conceded a single goal prior to Tuesday’s Champions League opener. His forced withdrawal against Juventus is a significant blow for Manuel Pellegrini’s side, especially given Kompany’s history of calf problems. The City captain has been plagued by similar injuries throughout his career, leading to concerns about his long-term availability.\n\nPellegrini expressed his immediate worry in the post-match media briefing, acknowledging the severity of losing such a pivotal player. \"It's a very important injury for Vincent,\" he reiterated. \"He was playing very well and we hope it's not a serious one. We will know more after he has a scan.\" The manager also confirmed that Sergio Aguero, who had been substituted in the first half of Saturday's Premier League win over Crystal Palace, was not fit enough to feature against the Italians. The absence of both Kompany and Aguero highlights the squad depth challenges that City might face as they navigate a demanding schedule of domestic and European fixtures. The team’s strong start to the Premier League season has built high expectations, and maintaining that momentum will require all players to stay fit and perform.\n\nThe defensive partnership between Kompany and Otamendi was one that City fans were eager to see develop, with the Argentine having been eased into the squad. Now, Otamendi is likely to be thrust into a starting role much sooner than anticipated, potentially alongside Eliaquim Mangala or Martin Demichelis. The loss to Juventus, despite Kompany's early influence in pressuring Giorgio Chiellini for the own goal, marked a disappointing start to City’s Champions League campaign. The focus will now shift to how Pellegrini reshapes his defence and inspires a response from his team in the upcoming derby against Manchester United. The media will undoubtedly scrutinize City’s defensive performance in the absence of their influential captain, Vincent Kompany, as they aim to bounce back from this early European setback and continue their impressive domestic form.",

But , the force said there was \" no basis in law \" for refunds , which would have \" come from the public purse \" . Many of the drivers paid the fines, unaware of the underlying error. The revelation sparked considerable public outcry and anger among those affected, who felt unfairly penalised by the West Yorkshire Police. Drivers expressed frustration that the force was acknowledging the invalidity of the tickets while simultaneously refusing any form of recompense. Legal experts weighed in, questioning the ethical implications of retaining funds collected unlawfully, even if there was no direct legal precedent for a refund. Some argued that while the law might not explicitly mandate refunds in such a unique administrative error scenario, the principle of unjust enrichment should apply, where one party should not benefit from another's loss caused by their own mistake.\n\nThe situation put the West Yorkshire Police under significant pressure to explain why such a fundamental error occurred and why transparency about the issue took so long. Critics pointed out that the public's trust in the police, particularly in the impartiality and correctness of their enforcement actions, could be severely damaged. The Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire acknowledged the serious nature of the administrative error and stated that a full internal review was underway to understand how the invalid tickets were issued by PCSOs for such an extended period without detection. This review aimed to identify weaknesses in the internal processes and implement robust measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nFor the many individuals who had already paid their tickets, often under the threat of further penalties or points on their license, the news was a bitter pill. Some indicated they would explore avenues for collective legal action, seeking advice on whether a class-action lawsuit could compel the force to refund the monies. Consumer rights groups also got involved, advocating on behalf of the affected drivers and calling for a clearer legal framework to address situations where administrative errors by public bodies lead to financial detriment for citizens. The incident highlighted a significant loophole in the system, where a clear administrative blunder by the West Yorkshire Police left thousands of citizens out of pocket with seemingly no recourse, raising fundamental questions about accountability and citizen protection when dealing with official enforcement. The cost of individual legal challenges for the drivers would likely outweigh the value of the tickets, further complicating their options. The PCSO role and the scope of their powers were also re-examined in light of the incident.",

Ahmed was arrested at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, after bringing a homemade clock to school that teachers and officials mistook for a bomb. The incident rapidly escalated, drawing national and international attention and igniting a widespread debate about Islamophobia and racial profiling. Ahmed, an aspiring inventor, had merely intended to show off his creation to his engineering teacher. Instead, the clock’s circuit board and wires, visible inside a pencil case, led to his apprehension, interrogation without parental presence, fingerprinting, and a trip to a juvenile detention center.\n\nThe public outcry was immediate and immense.

Basildon Crown Court heard one defendant been caught in France with migrants in the back of his lorry 11 days before the Tilbury incident . Timothy Murphy from Londonderry was fined √Ç¬£5,000 in August . Prosecutor Michael Goodwin told the court that the 35 migrants, including 15 children, were discovered on August 16 last year inside a container on the MV Titania, which had arrived at Tilbury Docks from Zeebrugge, Belgium. Conditions within the sealed container were described as “inhumane and life-threatening,” with temperatures soaring and oxygen levels depleting rapidly during the 10-hour voyage. The court heard that the victims had been deliberately locked inside the unit.\n\nMr. Goodwin explained that port officials heard unusual noises coming from within the container. Upon opening it, they found terrified and struggling individuals, many suffering from severe dehydration and hyperthermia. Among them was Meet Singh, 47, from Afghanistan, who tragically died during the journey. A post-mortem examination concluded that his death was caused by a combination of dehydration and hyperthermia.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that the four defendants, Stephen McLaughlin, 31; Martin McGlinchey, 49; Christopher Murphy, 20; and Timothy Murphy, 33, all from Londonderry, were part of an organised criminal conspiracy to smuggle people into the UK for financial gain. Mr. Goodwin highlighted Timothy Murphy's previous conviction in France, where he was caught attempting to transport 15 migrants in his lorry. This incident, just days before the Tilbury tragedy, suggested a sophisticated and repeated enterprise.\n\nThe court heard evidence that the defendants had been in regular contact via burner phones, coordinating their movements leading up to the incident. CCTV footage and phone data linked them to the vehicle carrying the container and to locations near Zeebrugge. The prosecution argued that the defendants were fully aware of the dangerous conditions the migrants would endure and showed a callous disregard for human life.\n\nAll four defendants deny a charge of conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry into the UK and a charge of manslaughter in relation to Mr. Singh’s death. The trial at Basildon Crown Court is expected to last several weeks, with further evidence to be presented regarding the planning and execution of the smuggling operation and the role each defendant played. The focus remains on establishing the extent of their knowledge and involvement in this tragic event, which ultimately cost a man his life and put dozens of others in extreme peril at Tilbury Docks in Essex.",

Challenges included staff shortages and increased use of new psychoactive substances , leading to more \" unpredictable and violent behaviour \" . But inspectors also found good staff - prisoner relationships and a \" good range \" of training and education . Despite safety declining since 2013 , Mr Clarke described it as a \" mixed picture of progress throughout the prison estate. While some institutions demonstrated resilience and effective leadership, Peter Clarke's report highlighted a persistent struggle with systemic issues that continued to undermine the safe and effective operation of many establishments across England and Wales. The surge in violence, often linked directly to the ready availability of illicit drugs like spice, placed immense strain on both resources and the morale of dedicated staff.\n\nA significant challenge identified by Clarke was the ongoing problem of staff retention. This issue, exacerbated by the demanding and often dangerous work environment, meant that many prisons struggled to deliver a full daily regime, leading to extended periods of lock-up for prisoners. Such reduced out-of-cell time often fueled frustration and further escalated tensions within already volatile environments. Crucially, the report by Clarke also drew attention to the critical issue of prison capacity. Many establishments were operating significantly above their certified normal accommodation. This widespread overcrowding, where cells designed for a single inmate were frequently housing two or even three, directly contributed to the documented decline in safety and the notable increase in violent incidents. It severely limited personal space, heightened friction between inmates, and made effective supervision considerably more difficult for staff.\n\nPeter Clarke underscored the urgent need for sustained investment, not just in the physical infrastructure of prisons, but vitally in the recruitment, retention, and well-being of frontline staff. He emphasized that prioritizing the mental and physical health of both prisoners and staff was essential for creating environments truly conducive to rehabilitation, rather than merely containment. The Chief Inspector warned that without tackling these deep-seated structural issues, including the fundamental mismatch between the rising prison population and the available certified normal accommodation, the risk of further deterioration in safety and order within the nation's prisons remained unacceptably high. His findings provided a sobering assessment, urging the government to adopt a comprehensive and strategic approach to adequately resource and manage the future integrity of the entire prison system.",

The statue, erected in 1958, serves as a poignant reminder of her brief but impactful time in England, where she was presented to King James I and Queen Anne. Her story embodies the early, complex interactions between European settlers and Native American communities, particularly her marriage to English tobacco planter John Rolfe, which was instrumental in a period of peace for the early Jamestown colony.\n\nThe updated Historic England listing now explicitly acknowledges her Algonquian heritage and the often-misrepresented narratives surrounding her life, highlighting the agency she exercised within challenging circumstances. This recognition underscores the effigy's importance not merely as a local landmark in Gravesend, Kent, but as a national symbol of a pivotal moment in global history. The Grade II listing ensures the continued preservation of this unique memorial, reflecting its special architectural and historical interest. It emphasizes her tragic death at a young age in Gravesend before she could return to her native Virginia, underscoring the profound human cost of early colonial expansion and intercultural exchange.

    "sentence": "Hina Rabbani Khar 's remarks came hours after the two armies agreed to \" de - escalate \" tensions after a meeting of their chiefs of operations . Tensions have risen following deadly exchanges along the border last week . The violence has plunged the neighbours into the worst crisis in relations since the Mumbai attacks of 2008 , blamed on militants based in Pakistan . \" Instead of issuing belligerent statements by the military and political leaders, it is imperative that both sides show restraint and engage in meaningful dialogue to de-escalate tensions along the Line of Control. The recent violence, following the deadly exchanges last week, has indeed brought the two nuclear-armed neighbours to the precipice of a dangerous confrontation, reminiscent of the heightened animosity seen in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks of 2008, which India squarely blames on Pakistan-based militants.\n\nHina Rabbani Khar's remarks, therefore, carry significant weight at this critical juncture. As a former top diplomat, her call for calm and adherence to the agreed-upon de-escalation mechanisms underscores the diplomatic path forward. Ms Khar's emphasis on finding a peaceful resolution, rather than resorting to aggressive rhetoric or military posturing, highlights the need for a sustained effort to build trust and prevent further bloodshed on the border. The focus should now be on ensuring that the understanding reached by the chiefs of operations is implemented in spirit and letter, thereby paving the way for a more stable environment. Both nations must prioritize the well-being of their citizens over jingoistic narratives, working towards a future where such crises do not repeatedly threaten regional peace. The international community, too, has a role to play in encouraging both India and Pakistan to maintain channels of communication and address their core disputes through peaceful means, rather than allowing cross-border incidents to spiral out of control.",

Cormack's move signifies a new era of ambition for the Pittodrie club, long reliant on its loyal local fanbase and shrewd financial management. His vast experience in building and scaling successful tech companies, particularly his ability to identify and leverage growth opportunities, is seen as a major asset that could transform Aberdeen's commercial and global reach. The club has openly sought international investment for some time, with chairman Stewart Milne expressing a consistent desire to expand its network beyond traditional Scottish boundaries. Cormack's American base in Atlanta provides a crucial bridge to the lucrative US market, offering significant potential for new sponsorships, merchandising, and even strategic club partnerships that could benefit both on-field performance and commercial revenues. His stated focus on 'maximising potential' is widely understood to encompass not just player development and consistent on-field success, but also the acceleration of the club's crucial infrastructure projects, including the new state-of-the-art training facilities and the proposed stadium at Kingsford. The synergy between Cormack's modern business acumen and Stewart Milne's deep understanding of Scottish football and local dynamics promises a formidable leadership duo for Aberdeen. Fans across Scotland, and particularly in the north-east, are highly optimistic that this injection of expertise and capital will propel Aberdeen back to consistent European qualification and allow them to more regularly challenge the traditional dominance of the Glasgow giants. The board believes that Cormack’s global network and entrepreneurial spirit will be instrumental in securing the club's long-term financial future, moving it towards a more self-sustaining model that combines high sporting ambition with robust financial prudence. His commitment to dedicating significant personal time, alongside his financial support, underscores the seriousness of his intent to help his boyhood club flourish on a truly broader, international stage.",

    "sentence": "Investigators think the blast was caused by a female suicide bomber from the Islamic State group . Correspondents say Turkey is cracking down on the militants , after previously being accused of ignoring them . But the blast triggered violent protest in Istanbul , with police using water cannon , teargas and rubber bullets . Friday 's bomb hit a group of youth activists planning to cross into Syria to help rebuild the town of Kobane . A video shows the group holding a news conference to discuss their plans , when an explosion rips through the crowd. The chaotic footage, widely circulated online, shows bodies strewn across the ground, thick smoke billowing upwards, and survivors screaming amidst the debris. At least 32 people were killed in the attack in Suruc, a town bordering Syria, and over 100 were wounded. The vast majority of the victims were members of the Federation of Socialist Youth Associations (SGDF), who had gathered at the Amara Culture Centre before their planned journey to Kobane. Their mission was to help reconstruct the Syrian Kurdish town, which had been devastated by a four-month siege by Islamic State militants last year before being liberated by Kurdish forces.\n\nThe Turkish authorities swiftly identified the perpetrator as a female suicide bomber with suspected links to the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS or Daesh. This attack marked a significant escalation of the conflict onto Turkish soil, putting immense pressure on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s government. Critics had long accused Ankara of turning a blind eye to, or even tacitly supporting, hardline Islamist groups in Syria as part of its strategy to undermine President Bashar al-Assad. However, following the Suruc bombing, Turkey vowed a more aggressive stance. Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu condemned the 'barbaric' act and pledged to intensify efforts against all terrorist organizations.\n\nThe blast immediately ignited widespread outrage and protests across Turkey, especially in Istanbul, where demonstrators clashed violently with police. The previously mentioned use of water cannon, teargas, and rubber bullets underscores the ferocity of these confrontations, as protesters accused the government of complicity or negligence in failing to prevent such an attack. Many felt the bombing was a direct consequence of Turkey's perceived inaction against Islamic State, particularly along its lengthy border with Syria, which has been a conduit for foreign fighters joining militant groups.\n\nIn the days that followed, Turkish security forces launched a series of nationwide raids, detaining hundreds of suspected militants from various groups, including alleged members of the Islamic State. The government stated that these operations were a comprehensive crackdown on terrorism, moving beyond just ISIS to target Kurdish separatist groups like the PKK as well. This broader approach, however, drew criticism from those who believed it was an attempt to deflect attention from the core issue of Islamic State infiltration and to suppress Kurdish political movements. The bombing in Suruc profoundly reshaped Turkey’s domestic security landscape and its foreign policy towards Syria, signalling a more direct and assertive, albeit complex, engagement in the fight against regional extremism.",

The SNP's Stewart Hosie said there needed to be \"absolute transparency\" to ensure the \"best deal is made on behalf of the tax-payer\".\n\nMr Hosie's demand for \"absolute transparency\" highlights the need for stringent oversight. He questioned the ¬£10m outlay, despite projected ¬£775,000 annual savings, demanding meticulous scrutiny of long-term value. The refit, involving interior modifications for VIP transport, has drawn criticism. Proponents, however, argue an RAF Voyager A330 offers superior security, flexibility, and availability for ministerial and PM travel over commercial charters.\n\nThe government's justification rests on long-term economic benefits and enhanced operational independence. The ¬£10m investment is projected to be recovered via savings in approximately 13 years. Utilizing an existing military asset, rather than chartering private jets, streamlines logistics for sensitive missions. This RAF Voyager A330, primarily a refueller, gains invaluable dual-use capability, maximizing its efficiency within the defence budget.\n\nA Ministry of Defence spokesperson emphasized this project delivers excellent value. The conversion allows the aircraft to maintain core military duties when not needed for VIP transport, preventing the expense of a dedicated executive jet. This multi-role approach is central to an efficient defence estate. Acknowledging the SNP's valid concerns, particularly Stewart Hosie's, the government pledged full disclosure on costs and progress. This aims to dispel \"vanity project\" perceptions and reaffirm fiscal prudence. Ultimately, the goal is to provide the PM and senior officials with secure, cost-effective travel, seamlessly integrating it with existing military assets. This ensures the RAF Voyager A330 remains a cornerstone for national security and state affairs.",

Dearden then dominated a stand of 90 with Mark Pettini ( 63 not out ) before being bowled by spinner Andrew Salter . Pettini steered the Foxes to a second batting point underneath the lights . Dearden , who was dropped on one , survived a couple of run - out chances in his lengthy vigil of 145 runs, an innings that anchored Leicestershire's first innings and set a challenging total for Glamorgan. His century, a testament to his resilience and growing maturity, included 18 fours and two sixes, played across more than five hours at the crease. It was an innings of two halves, patiently accumulating runs against the new ball before accelerating with Mark Pettini in a partnership that put the visitors on the back foot. The early scares, being dropped and almost run out, only seemed to steel his resolve, as he focused on building a substantial total for his team. His dismissal by Andrew Salter, a rare lapse in concentration, came from a ball that spun sharply back into him, ending a truly memorable individual performance.\n\nWith Dearden gone, Leicestershire still needed to consolidate. Mark Pettini, who had played an excellent supporting role, then took on the mantle of primary aggressor. He found an able partner in Ned Eckersley, and the pair continued to build on the platform Dearden had established. Glamorgan, despite their earlier breakthroughs, found it difficult to dislodge Pettini, whose experience shone through. Lukas Carey, though expensive in patches, continued to pose a threat with his pace and bounce, while Andrew Salter tried to tie down the scoring with his accurate left-arm spin. The Welsh county's bowlers, however, struggled to maintain consistent pressure as the pitch flattened out under the floodlights.\n\nPettini reached his own well-deserved hundred just before the close of play, guiding Leicestershire past the 400-run mark. They declared their innings at 415 for 7, giving their bowlers a brief spell at Glamorgan's openers before stumps. The declaration was a clear statement of intent, aiming to put Glamorgan under pressure immediately. Glamorgan faced a tricky 10-over period under lights, which proved challenging. Sam Northeast and Nick Selman weathered the initial storm, but the Foxes' new ball bowlers, led by Chris Wright, made them play at everything. Glamorgan ended the day on 28 for 1, having lost Selman cheaply, caught at slip off a superb delivery from Gavin Griffiths. Northeast (15 not out) and Marnus Labuschagne (8 not out) will resume tomorrow, with Glamorgan still trailing by a substantial 387 runs. The match remains finely poised, with Leicestershire holding a clear advantage due to Dearden's heroics and Pettini's late flourish, but Glamorgan will be hoping their strong batting line-up can respond on what appears to be a good batting surface. The early wickets on day two will be crucial for both sides as the contest heats up in this Championship clash.",

Taylor, known for his explosive power and intelligent boxing, wasted no time in asserting his dominance. He moved fluidly, cutting off the ring and landing sharp, accurate jabs that quickly reddened Mate’s face. The Edinburgh crowd, already buzzing with anticipation, roared with every connection. Taylor’s southpaw stance and powerful left hand proved particularly problematic for the Hungarian, who struggled to find his rhythm or land anything significant in return.\n\nWithin the first minute, a blistering combination from Taylor – a left hook followed by a straight right – sent Mate stumbling backward into the ropes. The Commonwealth gold medallist, sensing an early finish, pressed home his advantage with relentless aggression. Mate showed commendable resilience, trying to clinch and weather the storm, but Taylor's precision and volume of punches were overwhelming. Just past the midway point of the opening round, a perfectly timed left uppercut from Taylor snapped Mate’s head back, followed by a crunching right hook that sent the visitor to the canvas.\n\nThe referee immediately began his count as Mate struggled to regain his footing, his eyes glazed. Although he managed to clamber upright at the count of nine, his legs were clearly unsteady, and the referee wisely waved off the contest, deeming him unable to continue.

The injury to Juan Mata is a big concern. He is a key player for us, and his creativity will be missed. We will assess the extent of the injury, but it did not look good.

It is hoped the recovered parts will be put on public display , offering a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during World War Two.\n\nPilot Officer Penketh, aged just 20 at the time of the tragedy, was flying a Supermarine Spitfire Mk IIa, a crucial fighter aircraft during the Battle of Britain and its aftermath. While the exact cause of the crash remains unknown, it is speculated that he may have been attempting to steer his damaged aircraft away from the village of Holme, thus preventing further casualties on the ground, a common act of heroism among pilots of that era. His decision not to bail out, despite the clear danger, underscores the immense courage displayed by so many young men in the face of conflict. Harold Penketh's name is commemorated on the Brighton & Hove War Memorial, serving as a permanent tribute to his ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThe archaeological team, working closely with aviation historians and military experts, undertook a meticulous excavation following the successful geophysical survey. This state-of-the-art technique had revealed anomalies beneath the surface, consistent with buried metallic objects, leading them directly to the crash site. Over several weeks, a variety of artefacts were carefully unearthed, including fragments of the Spitfire's engine, sections of the fuselage, instrumentation, and personal effects believed to belong to Pilot Officer Penketh. Each piece recovered tells a part of the story, shedding light on the intensity of aerial combat and the grim reality faced by those defending the nation's skies.\n\nThe ongoing conservation efforts aim to stabilise and preserve these precious relics. Plans are underway to create an exhibit, potentially at a local museum or a dedicated aviation heritage centre, which will not only showcase the recovered Spitfire components but also tell the personal story of Harold Penketh and the wider context of the Rhodesian Squadron Royal Air Force's operations from RAF Wittering during the war. This display will serve as an educational resource, ensuring that the bravery of individuals like Penketh and the vital role of the Spitfire in Britain's defence are never forgotten. It will allow visitors to connect directly with a piece of history, understanding the profound human cost of freedom and the legacy of the young pilots who flew from bases like RAF Wittering.

In the UK , concern had risen sharply about the availability of talent . The number of chief executives concerned about the availability of key skills had risen sharply. This growing talent crunch in the UK, as revealed by the PwC survey, is seen as a significant threat to growth and competitiveness. Many UK businesses report struggling to find and retain staff with essential digital and technical competencies, leading to increased investment in upskilling existing workforces and a focus on attracting international talent where possible.\n\nIn contrast to the UK's talent focus, business leaders in Germany and France voiced different primary concerns. German CEOs, while relatively more optimistic than their French counterparts, were predominantly worried about global demand slowdowns and geopolitical instability impacting their export-heavy industries. The eurozone's tepid recovery also cast a shadow, with concerns over deflation and consumer spending remaining high. In France, chief executives were more preoccupied with domestic regulatory burdens and the need for structural reforms to stimulate economic activity. Confidence levels remained subdued across both nations, reflecting a cautious European outlook amidst ongoing economic uncertainties and the lingering effects of the debt crisis.\n\nGlobally, the PwC survey of over 1,300 CEOs highlighted a universal shift towards caution. Beyond Russia's unique challenges stemming from sanctions and falling oil prices, and the UK's specific talent woes, the overall sentiment was one of strategic retrenchment.

Four men received sentences of between 18 and 30 years in jail This tragic incident, which unfolded on June 15, 2012, at the Campos Morumbi estate in Curuguaty, became widely known as the Curuguaty Massacre. The land in question was fiercely disputed, with landless farmers claiming it as state property intended for agrarian reform. The subsequent judicial process was highly controversial; human rights organizations and international observers heavily criticized the trial of the eleven farmers, alleging a lack of due process and insufficient evidence linking them to the police deaths.\n\nThe massacre provided the immediate catalyst for the Paraguayan congress to orchestrate a rapid impeachment of President Fernando Lugo. His swift removal, days after the killings, was seen as a politically motivated move to reverse his land reform agenda. Several regional governments, including MERCOSUR and UNASUR, condemned Lugo's ouster as a 'parliamentary coup,' leading to Paraguay's temporary suspension from these blocs.\n\nDespite the initial convictions handed down in 2016, a major turning point occurred in July 2017. The Supreme Court of Justice of Paraguay annulled the sentences against the eleven convicted farmers, including the four, citing a lack of concrete evidence and procedural errors. This landmark decision led to their immediate release, marking a complex legal saga that underscored the deep-seated land conflicts and political polarization in Paraguay.

The singer said he was \" incredibly chuffed \" by the success . \" Both tracks mean a huge amount to me so it really is amazing to see them go to the top of the chart together . \" Source : Official Charts Company Sheeran 's comeback follows a \" gap year \" where he removed himself from social media and touring to travel the world and \"see more than the inside of a studio or a hotel room \". His decision to step away from the limelight, though temporary, allowed him to reconnect with his roots and find fresh inspiration, a move that has clearly paid dividends with this unprecedented chart dominance. The Official Charts Company confirmed that this double-top entry is a truly historic moment, reflecting the immense anticipation for new material from the globally adored singer-songwriter.\n\nThe two tracks, 'Shape of You' and 'Castle on the Hill', showcase different facets of Sheeran's musical artistry. 'Shape of You' is a catchy, rhythmic pop offering with a subtle dance influence, while 'Castle on the Hill' is a nostalgic, anthemic ode to his upbringing in Framlingham, Suffolk, capturing the essence of small-town life and youthful friendships. The contrasting styles demonstrate his versatility and broad appeal, ensuring both critical acclaim and commercial success. The immediate impact of both songs highlights the power of a well-executed comeback.\n\nThis phenomenal achievement comes amidst a highly competitive music landscape. While other artists like Drake have consistently dominated the charts in recent years with their own string of hits, Sheeran's simultaneous one-two punch is a unique feat that underscores his singular talent and dedicated fanbase. His return has undoubtedly revitalised the UK charts, bringing a fresh wave of excitement and setting a new benchmark for chart performance.\n\nUpon hearing the news, Sheeran reiterated his gratitude to fans, acknowledging the hard work and personal significance behind both tracks. \"It's been a long time coming,\" he remarked, referring to the creative process during his sabbatical. \"To have both songs resonate so deeply with people, especially 'Castle on the Hill' which is so personal, means the world to me.\" The Official Charts Company added that the sheer volume of streams and downloads for both tracks was staggering, easily surpassing all other entries. This unparalleled success solidifies Sheeran's position as one of the most influential and popular musicians of his generation, proving that a hiatus can sometimes be the perfect catalyst for even greater triumphs. His ability to connect with listeners on such an intimate level, coupled with his undeniable songwriting prowess, continues to set him apart in the global music scene. Fans eagerly await further announcements regarding his forthcoming album, which is now poised to become one of the biggest releases of the year. The initial reception to these two singles suggests that his \"gap year\" has only amplified his creative output, leading to an even more refined and impactful sound. The music world is watching closely as Sheeran continues to break new ground and redefine chart history, demonstrating an enduring appeal that transcends genres and generations.",

If administrator KPMG can not find buyers , the remaining stores will also shut . The chain employed 1,658 people . The chain was sold to Greybull Capital last year by supermarket Morrisons , which has said it would offer jobs to ex - My Local staff . It has struggled since being acquired by private equity firm Greybull Capital in September 2015. The chain, formerly Morrisons M Local, was sold off by the supermarket giant as part of a strategic shift away from smaller convenience formats to focus on its larger superstores. At the time of the sale, Morrisons provided significant financial support to Greybull Capital, including a loan of up to £25 million, to help stabilize the business and facilitate its turnaround. However, the investment proved insufficient to reverse its fortunes in an increasingly competitive market dominated by established players like Tesco Express and Sainsbury's Local, as well as discounters.\n\nThe challenges faced by the former Morrisons' M Local stores under Greybull Capital’s stewardship were multifaceted. High operating costs, coupled with intense price competition and shifts in consumer shopping habits, created a difficult trading environment. Despite efforts to rebrand and reposition the stores as ‘My Local’, aiming for a community-focused offering, the chain failed to gain significant traction or achieve sustainable profitability. The decision to appoint KPMG as administrators came after a period of intense financial pressure, leaving no viable path forward without significant restructuring.\n\nKPMG's immediate priority has been to manage the closure of the 93 unprofitable stores and to seek buyers for the remaining 32. Sources close to the administration process indicate that finding a single buyer for the remaining portfolio might be challenging, suggesting that individual or smaller clusters of stores could be sold off to other retailers or convenience store operators. The closure process will unfortunately result in the loss of a significant number of the 1,658 jobs, though Morrisons' proactive offer to re-employ former My Local staff, where possible, provides some relief to those affected. This gesture by Morrisons highlights its ongoing commitment, having initially established the convenience arm and then divested it.\n\nThe collapse of My Local underscores the difficulties even established players face in the convenience sector. For Greybull Capital, this represents a significant setback, adding to their mixed portfolio of investments. The future of the remaining 32 stores hinges entirely on KPMG’s ability to secure buyers within a reasonable timeframe, failing which, they too will inevitably shut, marking the complete disappearance of the My Local brand from the high street, less than a year after its high-profile launch under Greybull.",

His collection, meticulously preserved, offers an unparalleled glimpse into the daily lives of soldiers, the harsh landscapes, and the stark realities of conflict that shaped the early 20th century. Among the items is his coveted Queen's Medal for South Africa, complete with multiple clasps, a testament to his bravery and presence in pivotal campaigns, including those in the Orange Free State. This remarkable archive not only documents his personal journey but also provides vital historical context to the operations of the British Empire during a period of immense geopolitical change. Charles Hanson emphasized that such a comprehensive and personal archive is exceedingly rare, offering historians and collectors a unique opportunity to connect directly with the past. Oliver’s images capture both the grim determination of the troops and unexpected moments of camaraderie and quiet reflection, far removed from the staged photographs often seen from that era.

The sheer depth of the collection, detailing everything from medical tents to troop movements across the veld, makes it an invaluable resource for understanding the human cost and strategic challenges faced by the British forces. It truly is, as Hanson stated, a time capsule, brimming with untold stories and forgotten perspectives that challenge existing narratives of the conflict.

Human rights group Liberty said the Attorney General had given his family consent to apply to the High Court . An earlier inquest recorded a verdict of suicide on the 20 - year - old soldier . The coroner at a second inquest on Pte Cheryl James , who died at Deepcut in 1995, concluded in 2016 that her death was not suicide but an 'unlawful killing', a landmark overturning of the original finding. Pte James was one of four young soldiers who died from gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, in Surrey, between 1995 and 2002. The others were Private Geoff Gray, Private James Collinson, and Private Kevin Williams. All four deaths were initially ruled as suicides, leading to years of tenacious campaigning by their families, who consistently maintained that the circumstances surrounding their children's deaths were suspicious and that the original investigations were fundamentally flawed.\n\nThe tragic sequence of Deepcut deaths became a national scandal, shining a harsh light on welfare provisions, alleged bullying, and the duty of care within the British Army. Families, often supported by organisations such as Liberty, fought tirelessly to have the original inquest verdicts quashed and new inquiries launched, believing that vital evidence had been overlooked or mishandled. The case of Pte Cheryl James, in particular, gained renewed traction when her parents, Des and Doreen James, secured a fresh inquest following years of arduous legal battles. This second inquest heard compelling evidence of a pervasive culture of fear, harassment, and even alleged sexual exploitation at the barracks, which her family powerfully argued contributed directly to her death.\n\nSimilarly, the family of Pte Sean Benton, also found dead at the same Deepcut Barracks in Surrey, has long sought a new inquest into his death. His sister, Tracy Lewis, and other family members have consistently challenged the original suicide verdict, citing numerous inconsistencies in the evidence and a disturbing lack of proper investigation at the time. The recent consent granted by the Attorney General for Pte Benton's family to apply to the High Court for a fresh inquest underscores the profound and ongoing concerns about the integrity of the original inquiries into these tragic deaths.\n\nThese landmark cases, driven by the extraordinary persistence and courage of the bereaved families and their dedicated legal teams, have had a profound and lasting impact on the understanding of military deaths and the standards of investigation within the armed forces. They have critically highlighted the urgent need for independent oversight and a transparent justice process when service personnel die in non-combat circumstances. The re-examination of these deeply troubling cases, particularly through the High Court and subsequent new inquests, represents a pivotal moment in the collective quest for truth and accountability, offering a glimmer of hope for long-awaited closure to families who have endured decades of anguish and unanswered questions regarding the deaths of their loved ones at Deepcut and similar military establishments.",

The inquest was halted in October when new medical evidence led the coroner to refer the case to prosecutors . In March , the Crown Prosecution Service said there remained \" insufficient evidence to pursue a prosecution against anyone in connection with Jonathan's death. This decision meant that the coroner, Dr. James Adeley, could now resume the inquest into the circumstances surrounding the infant's passing. The hearing, which had initially begun in October of the previous year, aimed to establish the medical cause of death for Jonathan Percival, who was just 36 hours old when he died at the vicarage in Freckleton.\n\nDuring earlier sessions, disturbing details had emerged, including the starkly contrasting accounts from James Percival and Ruth Percival. James Percival, who claimed to have delivered the baby, maintained that he had attempted to resuscitate the infant, performing mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions. He described the baby as being born \"blue\" and not breathing, prompting his immediate intervention. However, Ruth Percival, the child's mother, presented a vastly different narrative. She testified that she was in the room throughout the critical period and did not observe James Percival making any efforts to revive Jonathan. Her testimony cast serious doubt on his account of the events leading up to the baby's death.\n\nThe new medical evidence that prompted the coroner to involve prosecutors was not publicly detailed but was understood to have raised specific questions about the circumstances of Jonathan's death and the care he received. Despite this, the CPS concluded that the evidential threshold for criminal charges could not be met. The family of Jonathan Percival, including Ruth Percival, expressed their ongoing desire for a full understanding of what happened to the newborn. The resumed inquest was expected to hear further expert medical testimony and revisit the conflicting accounts from James Percival and Ruth Percival, with the coroner's ultimate goal being to provide a definitive conclusion on the cause and circumstances of Jonathan's tragic death in Freckleton, Lancashire. The legal proceedings continue to bring to light the complexities and emotional toll of the case for all involved, particularly the parents seeking answers.",

All players are expected to be available from the very beginning.\" This firm stance highlights Gatland's unwavering commitment to player availability for the crucial tour preparations, which he views as non-negotiable for team cohesion and strategic development. The Lions squad, including key figures like Halfpenny, is due to assemble for their pre-tour camp on May 22, just under two weeks before the proposed Top 14 final. For Gatland, every moment of preparation is invaluable, especially with a demanding schedule of ten matches, including three Tests against the world champions, New Zealand.\n\nThe head coach has consistently emphasised that the integrity of the Lions tour takes absolute precedence, and that all selected players must be fully committed and present for the duration of the build-up. This policy has been a clear one from the start of the selection process. The coaching staff believes that any early absences would severely compromise the team’s ability to gel and perform at the elite level required to challenge the All Blacks on their home turf. Halfpenny, renowned for his defensive prowess, accurate goal-kicking, and strong counter-attacking game, is considered a vital component of Gatland's plans. His experience from previous Lions tours, particularly the victorious 2013 series in Australia, makes his early integration into the squad even more paramount. Richard Cockerill's attempts to secure Leigh Halfpenny’s release for such a significant club fixture are understandable from Toulon's perspective. However, Gatland's firm refusal reinforces the unique status and demands of the British & Irish Lions tour, which operates outside the usual club-versus-country dynamics.

The warning comes as the results of a serious case review into the abuse of patients at the private hospital near Bristol are due to be released . The abuse was uncovered during secret filming by the BBC Panorama programme . Eleven people have admitted charges of ill - treatment and neglect related to the abuse . South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board ( SAB ) commissioned the review , carried out by an independent investigator. The review meticulously examined the systemic failures allowing horrific abuse at Winterbourne View, the private hospital near Bristol. It delved into circumstances leading to patients being placed far from families and communities, a key concern highlighted by Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation. Their long-standing campaigns consistently warned against inherent risks of distant placements, which isolate vulnerable individuals, hinder family visits, and create environments where neglect and abuse are less likely to be detected.\n\nThe serious case review, commissioned by the SAB, sought to identify not only direct perpetrators but also broader institutional and commissioning failures. It scrutinised oversight mechanisms, or lack thereof, from local authorities and NHS trusts responsible for patient placement at Winterbourne View. Findings are expected to be stark, revealing how a system designed to protect vulnerable adults failed them catastrophically. The BBC Panorama exposé, using secret filming to uncover shocking abuse, served as a crucial catalyst, forcing a national reckoning with care quality for people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour in residential settings.\n\nThe eleven individuals who admitted charges related to ill-treatment and neglect represent a tragic failure of individual responsibility, but the review's scope goes far beyond individual culpability. It aims to provide recommendations to prevent such atrocities. These are anticipated to include a significant shift away from large institutional placements towards smaller, community-based care closer to homes and families. Strong calls are likely for improved regulation, robust inspection regimes, and enhanced staff training. Furthermore, the review is expected to highlight the critical need for better communication between care providers, commissioning bodies, and families, ensuring concerns are heard and acted upon promptly.\n\nMencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have advocated for comprehensive reform, pushing for person-centred care prioritizing individual rights, dignity, and access to a full life within their community. Their warnings about perils of out-of-area placements, often driven by lack of appropriate local provision or cost-saving, have been tragically vindicated by Winterbourne View. The SAB's commitment to releasing the full findings of this independent review demonstrates a crucial step towards transparency and accountability. Lessons from this harrowing episode must drive genuine, lasting change across health and social care sectors, ensuring safeguarding of vulnerable adults remains paramount. The imperative is to learn from systemic failures and implement robust measures to protect those who rely on specialist care, preventing any recurrence of neglect and abuse. The review's findings will undoubtedly inform national policy and practice, reinforcing the urgent need for a fundamental shift in how care is commissioned and delivered for individuals with complex needs, moving from isolated institutional settings towards inclusive, community-based support.",

UK Athletics said they do not respond to individual selection decisions, a stance that has often led to frustration among athletes vying for Olympic berths. The 26-year-old athlete in question was Shelayna Oskan-Clarke, whose omission from the initial women's 800m squad for the Games sparked considerable debate within the athletics community. Despite her consistent form and meeting the stringent qualifying standard multiple times, Oskan-Clarke's third-place finish at the national trials did not guarantee her a spot, as UK Athletics' selection policy allows for discretionary picks beyond the top two automatic qualifiers. This controversial approach meant that while Lynsey Sharp, another strong contender, secured her place, the final slot remained a point of contention. Oskan-Clarke’s powerful statement on eightlane.org highlighted the immense psychological toll such uncertainty and perceived injustice can take on athletes who dedicate their lives to their sport. Her public lament resonated with many who felt the selection process lacked transparency and fairness, especially given her demonstrated ability to compete at the highest level. The incident underscored ongoing concerns about the subjective nature of some selection criteria, which can leave athletes feeling vulnerable and disempowered, their Olympic dreams hinging on decisions that often seem inexplicable.

Pakistan has rejected an Afghan claim that it was involved the attack The unprecedented decision by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) to halt cricketing ties underscores escalating diplomatic tensions between Kabul and Islamabad. This dramatic move threatens to derail a planned T20 series and future bilateral engagements, as the ACB declared it could not play against \"a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe havens.\" The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) quickly hit back, accusing the ACB of \"playing politics\" and lamenting the politicization of sports. \"Cricket should unite people, not divide them,\" a PCB official reportedly stated, emphasizing the sport's traditional spirit.\n\nThe PCB further highlighted its historical role in nurturing Afghan talent, with many Afghan cricketers gaining crucial experience through Pakistan's domestic leagues and the Pakistan Super League (PSL). This cricketing bridge, built over years of shared passion, now appears severely damaged. From Afghanistan's perspective, however, the direct link established by its intelligence agencies between the recent attack and elements allegedly operating from Pakistani soil makes normal sporting exchanges untenable. The ACB’s statement reflects a broader national sentiment demanding accountability and an end to what Kabul views as cross-border terrorism. The Afghan government has consistently accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups that destabilize Afghanistan, a charge Pakistan vehemently denies, asserting its own struggles with terrorism originating from across the border.\n\nThe impasse poses a significant challenge for the future of cricket between the two nations. The diplomatic fallout from the attack is thus casting a long shadow over any prospects of immediate reconciliation, not just in politics but also on the cricket field. The Afghanistan Cricket Board’s defiant stance, backed by the Afghan government, signals that until Afghanistan perceives a tangible shift in Islamabad's policy regarding alleged militant safe havens, the sporting arena will remain inextricably linked to their deeply entrenched political grievances. The Pakistan Cricket Board continues to advocate for the separation of sports and politics, but without a resolution to the underlying security concerns, the future of cricket between these passionate rivals remains highly uncertain.",

    "sentence": "Campaign group Liberty says the powers , which are used by intelligence agencies to collect large volumes of data from electronic devices , amount to an \" assault on our freedom \" . The Investigatory Powers Act gained royal assent in November . The government has said it will defend the act . Powers covered by the act allow state agencies to control and alter electronic devices , read texts , online messages and emails, monitor phone calls and access location data. This controversial legislation, dubbed the 'Snooper's Charter' by critics, grants extensive surveillance capabilities to agencies like MI5, MI6, and GCHQ. Liberty, with director Martha Spurrier at the forefront, argues the act constitutes an \"assault on our freedom\" by enabling mass surveillance. Spurrier contends it permits indiscriminate data collection on ordinary citizens, setting a dangerous precedent for civil liberties rather than targeting specific threats. She calls it one of the most extreme surveillance laws in a democracy. Despite significant opposition, including from the House of Lords which sought stronger privacy protections, the Investigatory Powers Act gained royal assent. The government, under then-Prime Minister Theresa May, defended the act as vital for national security in the digital age. May argued it merely updated existing powers, bringing transparency and proper oversight through independent judicial commissioners. However, Liberty and other privacy advocates continue to challenge its proportionality. They highlight concerns over bulk data collection, device hacking, and the requirement for internet service providers to retain browsing history for 12 months, viewing these as unacceptable intrusions. Legal challenges are anticipated, potentially reaching the European Court of Human Rights. The act underscores a fundamental tension between state security and individual freedoms, with critics warning of a chilling effect on free expression.",

The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer , who announced plans to retire within the next year. The lack of clarity regarding Mr Ballmer's successor cast a shadow over an otherwise positive earnings report. Investors and analysts alike are keenly watching the search for the next chief executive, a decision that will profoundly shape Microsoft's future direction. Speculation has been rife, with names from both inside and outside the company being floated, including former Skype president Tony Bates and Ford CEO Alan Mulally, though Microsoft has remained tight-lipped about the process. The transition comes at a pivotal time for the Redmond-based software giant as it strives to redefine itself beyond its traditional Windows and Office strongholds.\n\nThis \"devices and services\" push, championed by Steve Ballmer, represents a fundamental shift for Microsoft. It aims to integrate hardware and software more seamlessly, mirroring the successful strategies of competitors like Apple. However, the pivot has not been without its challenges. The reception to Windows 8, Microsoft's flagship operating system designed for touch-enabled devices, has been mixed since its launch, failing to significantly boost PC sales in a declining market. The acquisition of Nokia's devices and services division, a deal spearheaded by Mr Ballmer, is central to this strategy, promising Microsoft greater control over its smartphone ecosystem and a stronger competitive position in the mobile space. Analysts believe that the success of this transformation will largely depend on the new leadership's ability to execute on Ballmer's vision while also adapting to rapidly evolving consumer demands.\n\nThe promised \"wide range\" of new products likely includes further iterations of the Surface tablet, potentially a smaller version, and new smartphones under the Nokia brand. The next generation Xbox console, though already launched, will also continue to be a key revenue driver. Despite the positive earnings, some analysts remain cautious, highlighting the intense competition in both the enterprise and consumer markets. The departing Mr Ballmer leaves behind a company in the midst of a massive strategic overhaul, and the next CEO will face the immense task of accelerating this transformation while simultaneously rekindling investor confidence and innovating at a pace previously unseen at Microsoft. The coming quarters will be critical in determining whether Microsoft can truly shed its legacy image and emerge as a dominant force in the mobile-first, cloud-first world.",

    "sentence": "The fine print of the deal suggests something slightly different , and shows that GM has in fact taken a hit of up to ¬£6bn in order to get shot of Vauxhall and Opel . First , a big chunk of the price - three - quarters of a billion pounds - is not for car plants , but for loans taken out by the owners of Opel and Vauxhall This unusual arrangement highlights that rather than simply selling an asset, GM is effectively paying to divest itself of a long-standing financial burden. The bulk of the £6bn charge, however, stems from the substantial pension liabilities that GM has chosen to retain rather than offload to Peugeot. Estimates place GM's retention of pension obligations for Vauxhall and Opel employees at well over £5bn, reflecting the enormous cost of legacy commitments built up over decades. This decision, made in Detroit, underscores GM's strategic imperative to clear its balance sheet of European losses that have plagued its financial performance for years. By retaining these liabilities, GM avoids the potentially complex and protracted negotiations that would have been required to transfer them to Peugeot, thereby expediting the sale and providing a clean break.\n\nThe deal, therefore, is less about GM selling a profitable division and more about a costly exit from a market where it has struggled to compete consistently. For Peugeot, this acquisition of Vauxhall and Opel presents an opportunity to significantly increase its market share in Europe and achieve substantial economies of scale. However, it also means inheriting a business that has been unprofitable for nearly two decades, requiring significant restructuring and investment to turn around. The challenge for Peugeot will be to integrate the Vauxhall and Opel operations efficiently, streamline production, and reduce costs without alienating the workforce or diluting the brands' appeal. The focus for Vauxhall under its new ownership will be on platform sharing with Peugeot models, standardizing components, and rationalizing the product portfolio to improve profitability. This move signals a definitive shift in GM's global strategy, allowing it to concentrate resources on more lucrative markets like North America and China, and invest heavily in future technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. The severance of ties with Vauxhall and Opel frees up capital and management attention, enabling GM to pursue its growth ambitions elsewhere, even if the price of freedom came with a hefty £6bn cheque.",

His uncharacteristic lapse saw him drag a delivery from Jamie Porter onto his stumps, ending his aspirations of a century.

Detectives worked tirelessly to piece together the events leading up to the fatal stabbing. The court heard how the assailant, riding a stolen moped, had pursued Stefan before cornering him in Nightingale Park, close to the area often referred to as the Red Pitch, a popular local recreation spot.

She was dismissed earlier this week following disciplinary proceedings but said she would appeal and had no regrets about speaking out . The Ministry of Justice ( MoJ ) said Ms Lennon was not dismissed for being a whistleblower . ' The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) maintained that Ms Lennon’s dismissal was the result of a comprehensive internal disciplinary process, unconnected to her claims regarding prison conditions. A spokesperson for the MoJ stated that all prison staff are expected to adhere to the highest standards, and where these are not met, disciplinary action will be taken. Citing employee confidentiality, they would not discuss specific details of Ms Lennon's case, but reaffirmed the decision followed a thorough investigation into her conduct, concluding that her actions constituted serious breaches of policy.\n\nKim Lennon, however, strongly refuted the MoJ’s narrative, asserting that the disciplinary charges against her were a deliberate attempt to discredit her and suppress vital information about the critical state of Lewes Prison. She told reporters that her complaints, made over an extended period, had consistently been met with insufficient action by management. \"I reported serious instances of drug dealing, violence, and a complete lack of control, which put both staff and inmates at immense risk,\" Ms Lennon stated. \"Instead of addressing these grave issues, the prison management chose to target me. They wanted to silence anyone brave enough to speak the truth about a system that is failing drastically.\" She highlighted that the current measures by the Ministry of Justice were clearly insufficient to tackle the deep-rooted problems within the prison.\n\nMs Lennon’s case brings to light the ongoing challenges faced by the MoJ in managing the escalating problem of drug smuggling and violence within the UK's prison estate. Independent oversight bodies and parliamentary committees have repeatedly raised concerns about the scale of the issue, with reports frequently citing staff shortages, overcrowding, and a lack of resources as contributing factors. Critics argue that the government's response to these systemic failures has been inadequate, leaving frontline officers like Kim Lennon vulnerable when they attempt to expose dangerous realities.\n\nThe former officer intends to take her case to an employment tribunal, where she hopes to present evidence not only of wrongful dismissal but also of the dire conditions she witnessed. \"My appeal isn't just about my job; it's about exposing the truth for the safety of everyone inside those walls,\" said Ms Lennon, vowing to continue her fight regardless of the personal cost. She remains steadfast in her belief that the public has a right to know the true state of affairs within their prisons, and that the MoJ must be held accountable for its duty of care. Her legal team is currently preparing the documentation, confident that they can demonstrate that Ms Lennon was unfairly targeted for her whistleblowing activities. The case is expected to draw significant attention to the broader debate around transparency and accountability within the prison system.",

Officials said among those arrested is a commander of the Colombian left - wing rebel group , Farc . Police said the suspects were part of a transatlantic drugs ring run by the ' Ndrangheta a powerful organized crime syndicate based in Calabria, southern Italy. This operation highlights the growing partnership between Colombian drug producers, particularly remnant factions associated with the dissolved Farc insurgency, and the sophisticated distribution networks of European mafias. Investigators revealed that the cocaine shipments originated in remote jungle labs in Colombia, often in areas previously controlled by the Farc, who either directly cultivated coca or levied 'taxes' on independent producers for safe passage and processing.\n\nThe sailing boats were chosen for their ability to blend in with legitimate maritime traffic, making them less conspicuous than large cargo vessels, and for their capacity to carry substantial loads without attracting undue attention. The routes typically involved crossing the Atlantic, often utilizing strategically located island nations as re-provisioning points before reaching European ports, predominantly in Spain and Portugal, for onward distribution across the continent. This particular bust involved meticulous intelligence gathering over several years, a collaborative effort spanning multiple law enforcement agencies.\n\nA significant breakthrough came with intelligence shared by The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which had been tracking the cartel's activities and its nexus with various Colombian narco-trafficking groups. Authorities in Colombia and Italy, alongside Europol and other European police forces, executed synchronized raids following the DEA's lead. Among the arrests were key logistical managers in Europe and several suppliers in South America. The Farc commander arrested in Colombia was reportedly a crucial link, responsible for ensuring the quality and quantity of the cocaine supplied and facilitating its transport to coastal rendezvous points. Further investigations are underway in the region, including in areas near Santa Fe, where some of the preliminary processing and logistics for the illicit drug trade are suspected to have taken place, demonstrating the intricate web of this criminal enterprise. The scale of the operation underscores the global reach of organized crime and the persistent challenge posed by the drug trade.",

Pearson said it was in discussions regarding the sale of the Economist but there was \" no certainty that this process will lead to a transaction \". This divestment of its print media holdings, including the iconic Financial Times, signals a clear strategic pivot for Pearson. The company, under CEO John Fallon, is increasingly focusing on its global education business, aiming to streamline its portfolio and concentrate resources on digital learning and assessment tools. This marks the end of an era for Pearson as a diversified media conglomerate, aligning with a broader industry trend of specialization.\n\nThe potential sale of its 50% stake in the Economist Group, which publishes the influential weekly magazine, presents a more intricate challenge. Unlike the straightforward acquisition of the Financial Times by Japan's Nikkei, the Economist has a unique ownership structure designed to safeguard its editorial independence. A trust holds a significant portion of shares, and a consortium of long-standing family shareholders – including the Rothschilds, Cadburys, and Schroders, alongside Italy's powerful Agnelli family through their investment vehicle Exor – own the remaining stakes. John Elkann, chairman of Exor, had publicly expressed interest in increasing their shareholding, emphasizing their commitment to maintaining the publication's journalistic integrity and distinct ethos.\n\nThis inherent complexity, requiring consensus among existing shareholders deeply invested in the Economist's long-term vision, explains Pearson's cautious statement regarding \"no certainty.\" For Pearson, completing these divestitures would solidify its identity as a pure-play education company, allowing it to dedicate all efforts to developing digital learning platforms globally and capitalize on the evolving education sector.

The court heard that AJ suffered \"catastrophic\" injuries, including a lacerated heart and internal bleeding, consistent with a severe impact. Post-mortem examinations revealed that Ayeeshia Jane Smith also had historic injuries, including a previous brain bleed and fractures to her ribs, consistent with her having been subjected to non-accidental harm on more than one occasion before her death.\n\nOpening the prosecution's case, Christopher Hotten QC told the jury that both Ms Smith, 23, and Matthew Rigby, 21, were responsible for the fatal injuries inflicted upon AJ. He alleged that the couple, who were in a volatile relationship, had engaged in a \"joint enterprise\" to inflict serious harm, or that one had caused the injuries while the other failed to protect the child. The jury was presented with evidence of a chaotic household where drug use, including cannabis, was prevalent. Ms Smith's admission about using her limited income support to fund drug purchases underlined the difficult environment AJ was living in. The prosecution highlighted texts and calls between Ms Smith and Rigby in the hours leading up to AJ's death, which painted a picture of tension and concern about AJ's health, specifically the worry that she may have ingested drugs.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Ms Smith maintained her innocence, accusing Matthew Rigby of being the one who inflicted the fatal injuries.

    "sentence": "It is understood the Hammers will raise their offer for the player who began his career at the east London club . Defoe , 34 , has scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for the Premier League strugglers this season . His latest goals came on Monday as Sunderland twice fought from a goal deficit to draw 2-2 with Liverpool at the Stadium of Light. Defoe's two penalties highlighted his undiminished quality and vital importance to David Moyes' struggling side. Despite their precarious Premier League position, Sunderland are resolute in their stance that Defoe is not for sale. Moyes has repeatedly emphasized that losing their prolific scorer would severely jeopardise their survival hopes, particularly given how indispensable he has been to their attack.\n\nWest Ham's pursuit, however, remains persistent. Manager Slaven Bilic is keen to secure a proven goalscorer, as the Hammers have suffered from inconsistent attacking performances and injuries this season. Bringing a player of Defoe's calibre and Premier League experience back to the London Stadium is seen as a key move to bolster their ambitions. The reported increased offer from the east London club is said to be around £6 million, but Sunderland are understood to value him considerably higher, closer to £10-12 million, reflecting his irreplaceable status. Defoe himself has maintained focus on his on-field commitments, embodying dedication to the Black Cats. His current priority is unequivocally keeping Sunderland in the top flight, a monumental task he has largely spearheaded. This transfer saga is expected to continue until the window closes, with West Ham anticipated to test Sunderland's resolve further, even as the Black Cats stand firm on their 'not for sale' position regarding their talisman.",

    "sentence": "Senioli , a scrum - half for Italian side Treviso pointed and smiled at Scott Williams , who plays for Welsh team Scarlets , as he ran towards the line during a crucial game in Italy . It should have been an easy try , but the Wales international , known for his relentless defensive work and never-say-die attitude, launched himself forward with a desperate lunge. The stadium, filled with passionate Italian fans roaring for Treviso, held its breath as Williams, defying the odds, somehow managed to get a hand to Senioli's ankle just inches from the try-line. The Treviso player stumbled, his momentum broken, and the ball, which he had been cradling loosely in anticipation of the score, was dislodged. It bounced once, tantalisingly close to the whitewash, before a Scarlets forward, arriving belatedly but opportunistically, dived on it, securing the turnover. The collective groan from the Italian crowd was almost as loud as the roar of relief from the small contingent of travelling Welsh supporters. Senioli, still sprawled on the turf, looked up in disbelief, the earlier smile replaced by a grimace of frustration. Scott Williams, quickly back on his feet, simply nodded, a silent testament to the high stakes of this cross-border encounter. This single moment, a testament to Williams's grit, shifted the momentum. Treviso, who had been dominating, suddenly looked rattled, while Scarlets, buoyed by the miraculous defensive stop, found a new surge of energy. The game, critical for both sides' European aspirations, hung finely in the balance, a true showcase of the intensity of rugby between Italy and Wales.",

    "sentence": "Writing in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing , clinicians say there is a growing trend for under-25s to seek the wrinkle - smoothing injections . But the research suggests \" frozen faces \" could stop young people from learning how to express emotions fully . A leading body of UK plastic surgeons says injecting teenagers for cosmetic reasons is \" morally wrong \" . Botox and other versions of the toxin work by temporarily paralysing muscles in the upper face to reduce wrinkling when people frown . Nurse practitioner Helen Collier , who carried out the research , says reality TV and social media are significant drivers behind this worrying trend. She observed that many young clients are influenced by the flawless, often filter-enhanced, appearances portrayed online and in popular culture, leading to unrealistic expectations about their own looks. Ms Collier, whose findings are detailed in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing, expressed particular concern about the psychological implications of intervening with a developing brain's ability to express and interpret emotions. She explained that the muscles targeted by Botox are crucial not only for frowning but also for conveying a wide range of human emotions, from surprise to sadness. If these muscles are routinely paralysed from an early age, it could hinder a young person's capacity to fully experience and communicate their feelings, potentially impacting their social development and emotional intelligence.\n\nThe research highlighted that while older patients often seek Botox to reverse visible signs of aging, younger individuals are increasingly opting for \"preventative Botox,\" hoping to stop wrinkles from forming in the first place. This shift in motivation raises profound ethical questions for practitioners. Ms Collier argues that genuine informed consent is difficult to obtain from teenagers, whose brains are still developing, and who may not fully grasp the long-term consequences of such procedures. She emphasized that the decision to undergo a cosmetic procedure like Botox should be made maturely, weighing the risks and benefits, something many under-25s are not yet equipped to do.\n\nThe British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), a leading body of UK plastic surgeons, has echoed these concerns, reiterating its strong stance against cosmetic injections for those under 18, deeming it \"morally wrong.\" Even for those slightly older but still under 25, BAAPS advises extreme caution and thorough psychological assessment before any treatment. They advocate for a focus on mental well-being and body positivity rather than promoting interventions that can have irreversible impacts on a young person's self-perception and emotional development.\n\nMs Collier's research, published in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing, urges clinicians to prioritize the mental health and developmental needs of young patients. She calls for stricter regulations around the marketing and administration of cosmetic injectables to minors and young adults, suggesting that a mandatory cooling-off period and psychological evaluation should be standard practice. She believes that practitioners have a duty of care to protect vulnerable individuals from potential harm, and this includes resisting the commercial pressures to provide treatments that may not be in the patient's best interest. The findings underscore the urgent need for a societal shift away from the relentless pursuit of an artificial ideal of perfection towards embracing natural beauty and promoting healthy self-esteem among young people in the UK and globally. This involves educating both practitioners and the public about the true purpose and potential downsides of procedures like Botox, ensuring that informed decisions are made, and that the emotional and psychological well-being of young people remains paramount. The long-term effects of widespread Botox use in this age group on collective emotional literacy and non-verbal communication are yet unknown, adding another layer of concern for experts like Helen Collier.",

Manley finished strongly with and eagle three on the par five 17th and a superb birdie four on the par-four 18th, completing a remarkable two-under-par round of 68. The Welshman, a relative unknown on the professional circuit and making his major championship debut, was visibly thrilled as he walked off the final green, acknowledging the cheers from the appreciative Royal Birkdale crowd. His impressive display, particularly his back-nine surge which saw him card three birdies and that crucial eagle, defied pre-tournament expectations in the notoriously challenging conditions.\n\nSpeaking further to BBC Radio Wales after his round, Manley reflected on the unexpected nature of his performance. \"Honestly, I was just hoping to make the cut,\" he admitted with a grin. \"To be up there on the leaderboard, even for a short while, is beyond anything I could have imagined. I've dreamt of playing in The Open my whole life, and to perform like this on the first day, at such an iconic venue like Royal Birkdale, it's just surreal. The course was brutal out there today with the wind and the rain coming in at times, so to post a score like that feels incredibly special.\"\n\nHis unexpected charge caught the attention of both seasoned golf commentators and the wider media. Suddenly, the focus wasn't just on the established stars, but on the plucky debutant who had briefly stolen the show. Manley’s humble demeanor and evident joy resonated with fans, who were quickly drawn to his underdog story. With three more rounds to play, the challenge of maintaining such form remained, but for one glorious day, the 38-year-old Welshman had announced his arrival on golf's biggest stage, setting a high bar for his own expectations and providing a compelling narrative for the championship.",

    "sentence": "The weapon was one of a pair of daggers discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1925 within the burial wrappings of the teenaged king . The origin of its unrusted iron blade has baffled scientists because such metalwork was rare in ancient Egypt . Tutankhamun was mummified more than 3,300 years ago . Italian and Egyptian researchers used \" a non - invasive X - ray technique \" to confirm that the iron blade was indeed of extraterrestrial origin, likely from a meteorite. The study, published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, analyzed the blade's elemental composition, revealing high levels of nickel and cobalt, elements typically found in iron meteorites but rare in terrestrial iron. This groundbreaking finding provided a definitive answer to a long-standing archaeological mystery that had puzzled experts since Howard Carter’s initial discovery of the dagger in Tutankhamun's tomb.\n\nThe sophisticated X-ray fluorescence analysis, conducted by researchers from the Polytechnic University of Milan and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, eliminated any doubt about the blade's celestial source. The presence of nickel, in particular, was a key indicator, as iron extracted from ores on Earth rarely contains such high concentrations. This suggests that ancient Egyptian metallurgists, despite their advanced skills in working with gold and copper, utilized this unique, readily available raw material from the sky. The fact that the dagger has remained largely uncorroded for over three millennia further supports its meteoric origin, as meteoric iron is often more resistant to rust due to its unique crystalline structure and composition.\n\nThis discovery sheds new light on the technological capabilities and available resources in ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period. It implies that the Egyptians were not only aware of falling 'sky-iron' but also possessed the skills to forge it into intricate objects of immense value, fit for a pharaoh like Tutankhamun. The cultural significance of such a material, literally descended from the heavens, would have been profound, adding to the mystique and power attributed to the young king. The other dagger found alongside it was made of gold, contrasting sharply with the 'celestial' iron one, highlighting the distinct and perhaps revered nature of the iron blade. This research emphasizes the interdisciplinary approach needed to unravel the secrets of ancient civilizations, combining archaeology, art history, and modern scientific analysis to provide unprecedented insights into the past of Tut and his people.",

    "sentence": "For the first time , MPs have agreed in a vote that we will begin the process of leaving the EU by the end of March . The government chief whip was seen with a massive grin after tonight 's vote . Remember ministers ' climbdown came with a clever kicker , persuading Labour to sign up to their timetable for triggering Article 50 without committing to very much in return The 'clever kicker' was the government’s commitment to publish a Brexit white paper and allow a parliamentary debate on the negotiating strategy before Article 50 is invoked. This strategic concession offered vital political cover for Labour MPs, particularly those representing pro-remain constituencies. It enabled them to vote for the timetable, framing their support as a push for parliamentary scrutiny rather than capitulation to Theresa May’s agenda. This allowed them to appease concerned constituents and avoid accusations of obstructing the democratic will.\n\nFor Theresa May, this parliamentary triumph is paramount. It solidifies her authority over the Brexit process, demonstrating her ability to command a Commons majority for her timeline. The chief whip’s satisfaction signalled successful navigation of perilous political currents, momentarily silencing critics. This outcome strengthens May’s hand for complex negotiations with the EU, reinforcing her narrative that the UK is united in its resolve to leave by the deadline. The focus now shifts decisively from the mechanism of triggering Article 50 to defining Britain's future relationship with Europe.\n\nHowever, deep divisions persist. While Labour’s leadership found a pragmatic way through, many within the party and the broader remain camp remain uneasy. The white paper offers limited real parliamentary power over final Brexit terms. Pro-remain voices will undoubtedly intensify as the immense complexities of disentangling from the EU become clearer, especially regarding single market and customs union access. The coming months will severely test the government’s resolve and party cohesion as Brexit’s true impact unfolds. This vote merely concludes the first chapter, ushering in the far more challenging phase of withdrawal and negotiation.",
