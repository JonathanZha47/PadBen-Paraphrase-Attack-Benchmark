Mr. Capp admits to causing Mr. Thomas's death but denies murder.\nAppearing for the defence, Dr. Croy, from Ashworth high-security hospital where Mr. Capp is detained, stated that he suffered from an abnormality of mental function, which could diminish his responsibility for Mr. Thomas's killing.\nDr. Croy further informed the court that Mr. Capp experienced paranoid delusional beliefs and heard two voices. One voice, identified as 'Mr. Grey,' reportedly instructs him to harm himself and others, the jury heard. She added that since his time at Ashworth Hospital, Mr. Capp has described voices commanding him to kill people with his bare hands. Conversely, a second, female voice acts as a protective guardian, offering him advice, the court was told.\nMr. Capp told Dr. Croy he believed he was being tortured at Cardiff prison in the weeks leading up to the incident and feared he would be killed.\nIn contrast, a separate consultant psychiatrist for the prosecution, Dr. Phillip Joseph, contended that Mr. Capp has a personality disorder rather than a mental illness. Dr. Joseph told the jury he believed Mr. Capp understood his actions when he killed his cellmate.\nMr. Thomas's body was discovered in the cell with a plastic bag over his head and approximately 100 stab wounds to the neck inflicted by a ballpoint pen.\nMr. Capp's defence rests on a plea of not guilty to murder due to diminished responsibility.

He had been fined £5,000 in August for this earlier offense. Prosecutor Michael Goodwin told the court how, on August 5th, 12 Afghan individuals were discovered in a locker inside Mr. Murphy's lorry, which was transporting frozen chips from Coquelles, France, to the UK. Goodwin emphasized that their presence was not accidental, stating they \"did not end up there by chance,\" implying deliberate placement. He added that Mr. Murphy maintained regular contact with co-defendants Stephen McLaughlin and Martin McGlinchey as he drove to Coquelles.\n\nEleven days later, on August 16th, the group of 35 Afghan Sikhs was located in the container at Tilbury. Mr. Goodwin recounted that dock workers heard noises from within and, upon opening it, found the occupants distressed and struggling for air. Meet Singh Kapoor, 40, tragically passed away during the overnight journey from Zeebrugge, Belgium.\n\nStephen McLaughlin (34, Limavady), Timothy Murphy (33, Elmgrove, Londonderry), Martin McGlinchey (47, Derryloughan Road, Coalisland, County Tyrone), and Taha Sharif (38, Kurdish, then living in Tottenham, London) have all entered not guilty pleas to charges of conspiring to facilitate illegal entry into the UK.

Key issues identified were insufficient staffing and a rise in the use of new psychoactive substances, which contributed to more erratic and aggressive conduct. However, inspectors also observed positive interactions between staff and prisoners, alongside a diverse array of training and educational opportunities. Although safety levels had worsened since 2013, Mr. Clarke characterized the situation as a complex blend of advancements and setbacks. During the July and August inspections, the prison held 770 inmates, significantly exceeding its Certified Normal Accommodation (CNA) capacity of 532, which indicates the number of prisoners that can be safely and humanely housed. Additional positive aspects noted in the report included better progress in rehabilitating inmates post-release. Conversely, some cells were in disrepair, and there was insufficient bedding. The report indicated that despite difficulties, the facility didn't feel unstable, and good staff-prisoner relations persisted. Michael Spurr, head of the National Offender Management Service, stated that even with considerable operational demands, the prison has maintained a constructive system offering ample purposeful activities and effective pre-release support for inmates. In contrast, the Howard League for Penal Reform, a campaign group, depicted it as an \"overcrowded and understaffed facility where drug access is easy, but clean bedding is scarce.\" The recently implemented smoking prohibition was noted as being \"unpopular among certain individuals.\" Frances Crook, the Howard League's chief executive, commented that while \"this inspection report for Cardiff prison is marginally better than other recent prison reports we've reviewed, it still presents significant reasons for concern.\" Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens, in her response, asserted that \"this report plainly highlights major areas of concern for Cardiff prison, adding to the numerous warnings the Prisons Minister has received.

This followed Henrikh Mkhitaryan's earlier equaliser, after United had initially conceded in the 20th minute. The match also saw United suffer setbacks with Juan Mata's injury and Antonio Valencia's red card.\n\nManager Mourinho commented that while Lukaku's goal was \"nice for him,\" it held little importance to him personally. He added, \"I told him I love what he does,\" praising the striker's assists, movement, and ability to hold up the ball, concluding, \"I like everything he does.\"\n\nMata's departure was due to a strong challenge from Sebastian Saucedo, though he's only expected to miss up to a week of play. Later, Valencia received a red card for a tackle on Saucedo. Referee Allen Chapman initially consulted with Mourinho before finally sending off the Ecuadorian. Mourinho explained the delay: \"The referee asked me to change the players and I didn't because I don't agree with the card.\" The Old Trafford manager further claimed Saucedo had been \"really aggressive with what happened to Mata and some other actions where he was a bit dangerous,\" but dismissed it as \"pre-season so no problem - it's a good experience.\"\n\nUnited's next fixture is against rivals Manchester City in Houston on Friday morning UK time (02:30 BST).\n\nBBC Sport's Simon Stone in Utah commented on the incident, suggesting referee Allen Chapman was compelled to act after Valencia's forceful tackle on Saucedo. Chapman, notable as the first video assistant referee to make a live decision in a 2016 USL game, reportedly first glanced at Jose Mourinho. After ensuring Saucedo was attended to, he approached the United manager, requesting Valencia be substituted, seemingly cautious about dismissing a player in a friendly. When Mourinho declined, Chapman, \"almost apologetically,\" proceeded to issue the red card to the Ecuadorian.",

These fatalities escalated political tensions in Paraguay, subsequently leading to President Fernando Lugo's removal from office by congress.\n\nIn the aftermath, four men were sentenced to 18 to 30 years in prison, with an additional seven individuals (men and women) receiving jail terms of four to six years. Testimony revealed the confrontation took place near Curuguaty, in eastern Paraguay's Canindeyu province. Approximately 250 riot police were dispatched to clear about 70 subsistence farmers from a Campos Morumbi agricultural company property. The farmers had been occupying the land to advocate for agrarian reform.\n\nNotably, the Paraguayan prosecution service failed to investigate the farmers' deaths, and both local and international human rights organizations raised concerns about judicial irregularities throughout the trial. Furthermore, five of the defendants undertook a hunger strike lasting over 30 days.\n\nUnequal land ownership has historically fueled violent conflicts in Paraguay. A 2008 census highlighted this disparity: a mere 2.6% of landowners control 85.5% of the country's land, while 91.4% of small farmers (with holdings under 20 hectares) possess only 6% of agricultural land. Advocates for agrarian reform largely attribute this imbalance to major agricultural conglomerates specializing in soy exports. The Curuguaty incident then served as the catalyst for the opposition Colorado Party to initiate impeachment proceedings against President Lugo, holding him responsible for the fatalities.",

Over 100 witnesses testified during the Cheryl James inquiry. In his ruling, Coroner Brian Barker QC strongly criticized Deepcut's welfare provisions, citing compelling evidence of a pervasive sexualized environment.\n\nRepresenting Pte Benton's twin brother Tony and his sister Tracy Lewis, Liberty submitted an application to the Attorney General in July 2015, seeking to nullify the initial July 1995 inquest and demand a new investigation. Liberty stated that since Pte Benton's death, numerous individuals have informed his family and publicly asserted their belief that he, originally from Hastings, East Sussex, endured physical and psychological bullying at the barracks.\n\nMs Lewis expressed being \"overwhelmed and disturbed by all the details of the shameful environment at Deepcut which have finally come to light through the Cheryl James inquest – it is terrible to think of Sean alone there.\" She added that over two decades after their brother's passing, and having recently lost both parents, she and Tony are \"determined to find out what happened to Sean.\"\n\nPte Benton was the initial casualty among four young recruits who succumbed to gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. Liberty highlighted that the first inquest, held merely a month after his death, involved testimony from only six individuals. Crucially, Pte Benton's medical and mental health records were not procured, nor was any evidence gathered or presented regarding his experiences at the barracks.

The inquest was previously suspended in October after fresh medical findings prompted the coroner to refer the matter to prosecuting authorities. By March, the Crown Prosecution Service had concluded there was \"insufficient evidence\" to bring charges against any individual.\n\nDuring the Blackpool Town Hall hearing, it was revealed that Miss Percival, who has special educational needs, sought a pregnancy termination at her GP surgery in August 2014. However, the procedure could not be performed as her pregnancy was too advanced. She admitted to having avoided confronting her pregnancy and to having concealed it from her parents due to fear of their response.\n\nMr. Percival, then the vicar of Holy Trinity CE Church in Freckleton, recounted that on the afternoon of November 25, upon her return from work, she spent time in the downstairs restroom. He described seeing her emerge from the bathroom around 3:30 PM GMT, carrying a towel he thought was soiled with excrement. They went outside to dispose of it when, he stated, \"Jonathan's leg came into view.\" He testified in court, recalling his words to Ruth: \"This is a baby, you can't put a baby in the bin.\" He then stated he laid the infant on the towel on the ground outside and tried to revive him. He described the baby as \"extremely cold, completely lifeless,\" concluding, \"The baby was clearly deceased.\"\n\nMedical evidence presented at the inquest indicated the baby was alive at birth. Miss Percival testified that she believed she saw the baby attempt to breathe, yet also stated, \"I somehow thought I had a miscarriage because, to me, the baby was dead when it emerged from me.\" Both Miss Percival and her father provided testimony indicating Jonathan's umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck.

However, Members of Parliament questioned if ministers, who ultimately named the ship after Sir David Attenborough, would consequently punish Professor Wingham.\n\nWingham was providing testimony to the Commons Science and Technology Committee regarding this highly publicized event, which generated immense public interest and divided opinion after \"Boaty McBoatface\" was overlooked for the main ship. He characterized the ministers' resolution to christen the primary vessel after the renowned zoologist and broadcaster – an option that ranked fourth in the survey – while also assigning \"Boaty McBoatface\" to a remotely operated sub-sea vehicle, as an \"eloquent compromise.\"\n\nWhen Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood asked about the episode's impact on public engagement in science, Wingham, an academic, asserted that the \"extraordinary attention\" it garnered could only be seen as an \"incredible success.\" He proclaimed that NERC could now \"make the claim that we are probably the best-known research council in the world.\" He further added that, as a result, \"hundreds of thousands of people, not only in the UK but around the world,\" now know about NERC and its scientific work.

There is a possibility Warburton could participate for the Cardiff Blues in their European Champions Cup play-offs before the Lions' departure. However, Gatland clarified that the decision regarding his immediate return to play rests collectively with Warburton himself, his clubs, and the medical team. While Sam informed Gatland last week that he felt capable of playing \"at a push,\" Gatland stressed the importance of not jeopardizing his recovery by pushing him too soon.

Peugeot is acquiring these outstanding loans at eighty percent of their book value.\n\nSecondly, GM will retain the majority of the existing pension liabilities.

Peugeot anticipates generating £1.5 billion in cost savings from the integrated operations, and should the deal help the French automaker penetrate new markets, it will have served its purpose.\n\nMeanwhile, GM continues to scale back its global ambitions and sharpen its strategic focus. Since receiving a bailout from the US government following the financial crisis, it has discontinued American brands such as Oldsmobile, Saturn, Hummer, and Pontiac, and divested its Australian plants, which had produced cars since 1931.\n\nThis strategic retraction might be perceived as a departure from former prominence, but it could also reflect GM's pragmatic conviction that its future lies in China – where it is the most robust US competitor – and in electric and self-driving vehicles, sectors where America, not Europe, holds a leadership position.",

He either needs to be silenced, defeated in the ring, or suspended, because we mustn't allow more hatred to be spread. I am fighting someone who struggles to control what he says.\" The Campaign Against Antisemitism has also demanded a ban for Fury and lodged a complaint with the British Boxing Board of Control. Fury, the undefeated 27-year-old who captured the WBA and WBO heavyweight belts from Klitschko in their initial encounter, later expressed regret for causing offense and pledged to improve his behaviour \"as an ambassador of British boxing.\" He also faced backlash following his victory over Klitschko last year, when remarks concerning homosexuality, paedophilia, and women prompted over 100,000 individuals to sign an online petition requesting his removal from the BBC's 2015 Sports Personality of the Year shortlist.",

    "sentence": "At the close of day three, the visiting team had reached 293 for 9, establishing a lead of 260 runs. Jacques Rudolph's pursuit of his inaugural Championship century in 2016 was prolonged when he was dismissed for 56, hitting the ball onto his own stumps. Previously, Essex had been dismissed for 319, with Craig Meschede achieving his first five-wicket haul of the Championship season, ending with figures of 5 for 84. The host team confirmed their promotion and clinched the second-tier title by surpassing 250 runs in their first innings, primarily due to captain Ryan ten Doeschate's century; he contributed an additional eight runs to his overnight total before being out for 117. As a bowler, Ten Doeschate (2 for 20) dismissed both Rudolph and Bragg (54) in his opening over. Bragg had just crossed 1,000 Championship runs for the season, and the duo had earlier formed an 89-run partnership for the second wicket. Although Glamorgan suffered a collapse, losing six wickets for only 36 runs, Mark Wallace (75 not out) and Timm van der Gugten (32) played crucial roles in extending their lead beyond 250. Glamorgan batsman Will Bragg commented to BBC Wales Sport: \"A four-day match can fluctuate significantly, but Wally (Mark Wallace) displayed tremendous resilience, placing us in a strong competitive position for the final day. Maintaining consistency throughout a lengthy season is challenging, so reaching 1,000 runs is gratifying. I find my batting to be more consistent when positioned at number three. I am pleased with how I've avoided throwing my wicket away frequently this year. While the team's performance has been disappointing, there are encouraging indications with emerging young talent, providing much to build on for the future.\"",

Jurors had previously learned of her apprehension that her 21-month-old daughter, Ayeeshia Jane Smith, might have suffered a seizure after ingesting drugs kept in their home. Both Ms. Smith and her ex-partner, Matthew Rigby, have pleaded not guilty to murder.\n\nAyeeshia, also known as AJ, died in 2014 at the couple’s apartment in Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire. During questioning by prosecutors, 23-year-old Ms. Smith admitted she initially refrained from informing doctors treating Ayeeshia about her fears that the child had accessed drugs, as she worried they would perceive her as \"a bad mother.\" She also explained her failure to notify police about the drugs in the house by stating she knew they were illegal. After Ayeeshia's death, approximately £30 worth of cannabis was discovered inside a Tommee Tippee plastic cup at the Britannia Drive property, but Ms. Smith claimed her daughter did not use that cup because it was broken.\n\nThe court heard that a senior social worker had reported Ms. Smith, of Sandfield Road, Nottingham, appearing \"spaced out\" during a home visit a week before Ayeeshia's collapse, although the child was not present at the time. Days before Ayeeshia's death, on April 17, 2014, two social workers attempted an on-the-spot drug search at the flat after smelling cannabis, but Ms. Smith refused to comply.\n\nThe prosecution also highlighted text messages Ms. Smith sent to Mr. Rigby and her parents, including one threatening her father on the day Ayeeshia died. Christopher Hotten QC, the prosecuting barrister, argued the message demonstrated her temper \"on the day somebody killed your daughter in anger.\" However, Ms. Smith disputed this, asserting, \"Nobody was angry on that day, or the day before that, nobody was being angry that day.\"\n\nJurors at Birmingham Crown Court were previously informed that Ayeeshia’s death was caused by her heart being torn by a forceful stamp. Medical experts testified that such injuries are typically only found in victims of severe car crashes or individuals who have fallen from buildings. The trial continues.",

At 34, Defoe has been a key player for Premier League strugglers Sunderland this season, scoring 11 goals in 21 appearances. His latest contributions came on Monday, helping Sunderland twice recover from a deficit to draw 2-2 with in-form Liverpool, a result that leaves manager David Moyes's side in 18th place.\n\nDefoe's senior career started at West Ham before a £7 million move to rivals Tottenham in 2004, a deal that saw Bobby Zamora transfer the other way. He then joined Portsmouth for £7.5 million in January 2008, only to return to Spurs for £15 million the following year. A surprising move to Canadian team Toronto FC followed in 2014, until former Black Cats manager and ex-Spurs teammate Gus Poyet brought him to Sunderland in 2015.\n\nBBC Radio 5 live's chief football correspondent, Ian Dennis, suggests West Ham will indeed test Sunderland's resolve again. However, it's considered inconceivable for the Black Cats to sell Defoe given their vulnerable league position. David Moyes recently described Defoe as \"priceless,\" stressing that his goal-scoring ability will determine their top-flight survival. The rarity of proven, high-calibre goalscorers is precisely why West Ham is pursuing the 34-year-old. While money often influences decisions, Defoe's value to Sunderland's Premier League campaign is truly unparalleled.",

The government's chief whip appeared visibly pleased after the night's proceedings. This ministerial concession was, however, strategically astute; it secured Labour's support for the Article 50 activation timeline with only a nebulous pledge of a future plan, potentially as insubstantial as a brief scribble.\n\nHowever, discontent simmers within Labour ranks regarding the handling of the issue, with reports of angry exchanges, suggesting some feel their leadership was outmaneuvered by the government's scheme. Pro-Remain Conservative dissenters remain highly skeptical of the government's underlying motives for providing further details on its Brexit strategy. Though they retreated today, their challenge is far from over.\n\nYet, beyond these immediate political maneuvers and the whip's evident satisfaction, the past 24 hours have underscored two crucial realities. Firstly, the vote's outcome indicates that very few MPs intend to outright obstruct Brexit or impede the process. While they will undoubtedly press the government for greater specificity and seek to modify any eventual proposals reaching the Commons, potentially causing disruption or delays, halting the departure entirely is not the objective for most.\n\nSecondly, it's equally apparent that Prime Minister Theresa May lacks a stable majority on EU matters. Once her detailed plans are finally presented to Parliament, she will almost certainly be compelled to make concessions. This explains the government's strenuous efforts in the Supreme Court to prevent parliamentary intervention before complex negotiations in Brussels even commence.",
