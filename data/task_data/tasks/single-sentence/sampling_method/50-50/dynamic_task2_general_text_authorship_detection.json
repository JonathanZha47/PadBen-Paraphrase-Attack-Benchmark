    "sentence": "RamJam uploaded Southern Rail Tycoon on Thursday , and so far 45,000 people have played the tongue - in - cheek game . The aim is to stop guards from boarding trains , which leads to services being cancelled as profits are collected from passengers . It was inspired by months of cancellations due to an RMT dispute . Once a sufficient number of train guards board on a train and a delayed service eventually departs , the player loses the round, and is presented with a screen showing plummeting profits and irate pixelated commuters storming a virtual London Victoria station. The game, created by Brighton-based indie developer Tom Jackson, under his studio moniker RamJam, has rapidly become a viral sensation. Jackson, a long-time frustrated commuter on the Southern Rail network himself, explained the inspiration behind the satirical hit: 'I spent so many hours delayed on platforms, watching those departure boards mock me, that I just had to channel that frustration into something. It started as a joke among friends, but the more I worked on 'Southern Rail Tycoon', the more I realised how many people could relate to the sheer absurdity of it all.'\n\nThe game’s dark humour resonates deeply with those who have endured the real-life chaos on the network. Players must strategically deploy various humorous obstacles, from ‘broken signal’ alerts to ‘leaf on the line’ incidents, all designed to prevent guards from reaching their designated carriages. The more services cancelled, the higher the player's 'tycoon' score, reflecting their fictional mastery over the beleaguered railway. If too many services depart on time, or if guards successfully board multiple trains, the player's 'profit margin' collapses, leading to a swift game over.\n\nDespite its cynical premise, Tom Jackson insists the game is not meant to be a serious political statement, but rather a cathartic outlet. 'It’s about making light of a difficult situation,' he stated. 'It’s satire. It’s a way for people to laugh at the chaos, rather than just fuming about it. We’ve had messages from people in London, Brighton, and all along the line saying how much they appreciate being able to turn their anger into amusement, even if it’s just for a few minutes.' RamJam is now considering updates to Southern Rail Tycoon, including new scenarios and 'disaster' events, as well as a potential mobile version, cementing its status as a cult classic for exasperated commuters everywhere.",

Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Melanie Croy told the jury Mr Capp 's ability to form rational judgement was impaired because of his mental illness . Mr Capp admits killing Mr Thomas but denies murder . Appearing for the prosecution, Mr. John Smith QC, told the jury that while Mr Capp's mental health issues were acknowledged, they did not amount to a defence of diminished responsibility or negate the intent to kill. He argued that the brutal nature of the attack on Mr Thomas, carried out while he was vulnerable and asleep in their shared cell on Wing B, demonstrated a clear intention. Mr Smith highlighted the evidence of pre-meditation, suggesting Mr Capp had planned the assault. Dr Croy, cross-examined by the prosecution, reiterated her assessment that Mr Capp suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, leading to a severely distorted perception of reality. She elaborated on his delusional beliefs, which had intensified in the confined environment of Wing B, particularly in relation to his cellmate, Mr Thomas. She stated that while he understood the physical act of killing, his capacity for moral judgment and rational decision-making was profoundly compromised. Prison officers also described Mr Capp's erratic behaviour in the days leading up to the attack. The defence, led by Ms Sarah Jones, countered that Mr Capp's actions were a direct consequence of his severe mental illness, which had been inadequately managed within the prison system. Ms Jones emphasised Dr Croy's expert opinion, arguing Mr Capp suffered from an abnormality of mental functioning which substantially impaired his ability to understand his conduct, form rational judgment, or exercise self-control. She painted a picture of a young man from Scotland whose untreated condition spiralled out of control, leading to the tragic death of Darren Thomas.

But , the force said there was \" no basis in law \" for refunds , which would have \" come from the public purse \" . Many of the drivers paid the fines, unaware of the underlying error. The revelation sparked considerable public outcry and anger among those affected, who felt unfairly penalised by the West Yorkshire Police. Drivers expressed frustration that the force was acknowledging the invalidity of the tickets while simultaneously refusing any form of recompense. Legal experts weighed in, questioning the ethical implications of retaining funds collected unlawfully, even if there was no direct legal precedent for a refund. Some argued that while the law might not explicitly mandate refunds in such a unique administrative error scenario, the principle of unjust enrichment should apply, where one party should not benefit from another's loss caused by their own mistake.\n\nThe situation put the West Yorkshire Police under significant pressure to explain why such a fundamental error occurred and why transparency about the issue took so long. Critics pointed out that the public's trust in the police, particularly in the impartiality and correctness of their enforcement actions, could be severely damaged. The Police and Crime Commissioner for West Yorkshire acknowledged the serious nature of the administrative error and stated that a full internal review was underway to understand how the invalid tickets were issued by PCSOs for such an extended period without detection. This review aimed to identify weaknesses in the internal processes and implement robust measures to prevent a recurrence.\n\nFor the many individuals who had already paid their tickets, often under the threat of further penalties or points on their license, the news was a bitter pill. Some indicated they would explore avenues for collective legal action, seeking advice on whether a class-action lawsuit could compel the force to refund the monies. Consumer rights groups also got involved, advocating on behalf of the affected drivers and calling for a clearer legal framework to address situations where administrative errors by public bodies lead to financial detriment for citizens. The incident highlighted a significant loophole in the system, where a clear administrative blunder by the West Yorkshire Police left thousands of citizens out of pocket with seemingly no recourse, raising fundamental questions about accountability and citizen protection when dealing with official enforcement. The cost of individual legal challenges for the drivers would likely outweigh the value of the tickets, further complicating their options.

Basildon Crown Court heard one defendant been caught in France with migrants in the back of his lorry 11 days before the Tilbury incident . Timothy Murphy from Londonderry was fined √Ç¬£5,000 in August . Prosecutor Michael Goodwin told the court that the 35 migrants, including 15 children, were discovered on August 16 last year inside a container on the MV Titania, which had arrived at Tilbury Docks from Zeebrugge, Belgium. Conditions within the sealed container were described as “inhumane and life-threatening,” with temperatures soaring and oxygen levels depleting rapidly during the 10-hour voyage. The court heard that the victims had been deliberately locked inside the unit.\n\nMr. Goodwin explained that port officials heard unusual noises coming from within the container. Upon opening it, they found terrified and struggling individuals, many suffering from severe dehydration and hyperthermia. Among them was Meet Singh, 47, from Afghanistan, who tragically died during the journey. A post-mortem examination concluded that his death was caused by a combination of dehydration and hyperthermia.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that the four defendants, Stephen McLaughlin, 31; Martin McGlinchey, 49; Christopher Murphy, 20; and Timothy Murphy, 33, all from Londonderry, were part of an organised criminal conspiracy to smuggle people into the UK for financial gain. Mr. Goodwin highlighted Timothy Murphy's previous conviction in France, where he was caught attempting to transport 15 migrants in his lorry. This incident, just days before the Tilbury tragedy, suggested a sophisticated and repeated enterprise.\n\nThe court heard evidence that the defendants had been in regular contact via burner phones, coordinating their movements leading up to the incident. CCTV footage and phone data linked them to the vehicle carrying the container and to locations near Zeebrugge. The prosecution argued that the defendants were fully aware of the dangerous conditions the migrants would endure and showed a callous disregard for human life.\n\nAll four defendants deny a charge of conspiracy to facilitate illegal entry into the UK and a charge of manslaughter in relation to Mr. Singh’s death. The trial at Basildon Crown Court is expected to last several weeks, with further evidence to be presented regarding the planning and execution of the smuggling operation and the role each defendant played.

Challenges included staff shortages and increased use of new psychoactive substances , leading to more \" unpredictable and violent behaviour \" . But inspectors also found good staff - prisoner relationships and a \" good range \" of training and education . Despite safety declining since 2013 , Mr Clarke described it as a \" mixed picture of progress throughout the prison estate. While some institutions demonstrated resilience and effective leadership, Peter Clarke's report highlighted a persistent struggle with systemic issues that continued to undermine the safe and effective operation of many establishments across England and Wales. The surge in violence, often linked directly to the ready availability of illicit drugs like spice, placed immense strain on both resources and the morale of dedicated staff.\n\nA significant challenge identified by Clarke was the ongoing problem of staff retention. This issue, exacerbated by the demanding and often dangerous work environment, meant that many prisons struggled to deliver a full daily regime, leading to extended periods of lock-up for prisoners. Such reduced out-of-cell time often fueled frustration and further escalated tensions within already volatile environments. Crucially, the report by Clarke also drew attention to the critical issue of prison capacity. Many establishments were operating significantly above their certified normal accommodation. This widespread overcrowding, where cells designed for a single inmate were frequently housing two or even three, directly contributed to the documented decline in safety and the notable increase in violent incidents. It severely limited personal space, heightened friction between inmates, and made effective supervision considerably more difficult for staff.\n\nPeter Clarke underscored the urgent need for sustained investment, not just in the physical infrastructure of prisons, but vitally in the recruitment, retention, and well-being of frontline staff. He emphasized that prioritizing the mental and physical health of both prisoners and staff was essential for creating environments truly conducive to rehabilitation, rather than merely containment. The Chief Inspector warned that without tackling these deep-seated structural issues, including the fundamental mismatch between the rising prison population and the available certified normal accommodation, the risk of further deterioration in safety and order within the nation's prisons remained unacceptably high. His findings provided a sobering assessment, urging the government to adopt a comprehensive and strategic approach to adequately resource and manage the future integrity of the entire prison system.",

This aims to dispel \"vanity project\" perceptions and reaffirm fiscal prudence.

Just past the midway point of the opening round, a perfectly timed left uppercut from Taylor snapped Mate’s head back, followed by a crunching right hook that sent the visitor to the canvas.\n\nThe referee immediately began his count as Mate struggled to regain his footing, his eyes glazed. Although he managed to clamber upright at the count of nine, his legs were clearly unsteady, and the referee wisely waved off the contest, deeming him unable to continue. The official time of the stoppage was just 2 minutes and 10 seconds of the first round, a truly emphatic and devastating performance from the Prestonpans pugilist. The packed Meadowbank Arena erupted in a deafening roar, a standing ovation for their hometown hero.\n\nAfter the fight, a beaming Taylor soaked in the adulation of the crowd, acknowledging their support. Speaking to BBC Scotland later, he reflected on the win, reiterating his surprise at the swiftness of the victory. \"I came here expecting a tough fight, maybe a few rounds to get warmed up, but I caught him clean early and just went for it. The support from the fans was incredible, it really spurred me on.\"\n\nManager Barry McGuigan, the legendary former world champion, watched on with immense satisfaction. \"Josh showed tonight exactly why we believe he's destined for greatness,\" McGuigan told reporters. \"His power, his speed, his ring intelligence – it's all there. He handled the pressure of fighting at Meadowbank in front of his home fans perfectly. This was a statement win, a clear message to the super-lightweight division. We're not rushing anything, as I said before, we've got to take the right fights at the right time to develop him properly. But he's learning and improving with every bout. We'll sit down, review this performance, and plan the next step. There are big fights out there for Josh, and he’s ready for the challenges that lie ahead. This performance only confirms that he is truly a very special talent, someone who could go all the way to the top of the sport.\" The victory marked another significant milestone in Taylor's rapidly ascending professional career, setting the stage for even bigger challenges and proving his pedigree on home soil against a credible opponent, even if the fight itself didn't last long. The buzz around Taylor grew exponentially after this dominant display at Meadowbank, solidifying his status as one of Scotland's most exciting boxing prospects, a true champion in the making, following in the footsteps of previous Commonwealth Games successes.",

United then lost Juan Mata to injury and Antonio Valencia to a red card . \" [ Lukaku 's goal ] is nice for him but not important for me , \" said Mourinho . \" I told him that what's important is the collective result, the three points, not his personal tally. His goal was crucial, yes, but it came in a game where we faced significant challenges, including going behind, losing Juan Mata to injury, and Antonio Valencia to a red card. These moments test a team's resilience, and I'm pleased with how we fought to get the win, but we must learn from the mistakes that put us in those difficult positions. The injury to Juan Mata is a big concern. He is a key player for us, and his creativity will be missed. We will assess the extent of the injury, but it did not look good. As for Antonio Valencia's red card, it was a moment of indiscipline that he knows was unnecessary. An experienced player should not make such a mistake, leaving his team with ten men and missing the next match. We cannot afford these kinds of errors if we want to compete for major honours.\n\nRomelu knows my expectations are high, not just for scoring goals, but for his all-round contribution. I want to see him link up play, press from the front, and be constantly involved in our attacking build-up, not just waiting for chances. Goals are a consequence of doing everything else correctly. He has the potential to be a complete forward for Manchester United, and we will continue to work on all aspects of his game. The team showed character to get the win after so many setbacks, including Henrikh Mkhitaryan's equaliser being cancelled out earlier before we recovered. However, the overall performance was not perfect. We gave them too much space at times and should have been more clinical to finish the game off sooner. We must improve consistently. We take the three points, analyse where we need to get better, and immediately focus on the next challenge.

You can see the energy he brings to training already. He’s been working incredibly hard to get back to full fitness, a testament to his dedication. His return couldn't come at a better time, especially with big games on the horizon. His presence will undoubtedly lift the whole squad, particularly in what promises to be a challenging Six Nations campaign. The scrum-half position is fiercely contested in Wales, but Webby’s proven pedigree makes him a standout. His ability to dictate tempo and exploit defensive gaps is something few others possess, and he’ll be looking for immediate impact. The foot injury in September was more serious than initially thought, requiring extensive rehabilitation. Webby’s resilience shone through a meticulous recovery program. This time away has only intensified his desire to perform for Wales. The media had speculated on his timeline, but Webb maintained focus, returning only when 100% ready. The focus now shifts to upcoming clashes, with the highly anticipated fixture against England always looming large. Having a player of Webby's calibre for such a crucial encounter is invaluable.

Perhaps unsurprisingly , Russia 's bosses have gone from the most confident to the least , due to problems caused by sanctions and the falling oil price . In the UK , concern had risen sharply about the availability of talent . The number of chief executives concerned about the availability of key skills had risen sharply. This growing talent crunch in the UK, as revealed by the PwC survey, is seen as a significant threat to growth and competitiveness. Many UK businesses report struggling to find and retain staff with essential digital and technical competencies, leading to increased investment in upskilling existing workforces and a focus on attracting international talent where possible.\n\nIn contrast to the UK's talent focus, business leaders in Germany and France voiced different primary concerns. German CEOs, while relatively more optimistic than their French counterparts, were predominantly worried about global demand slowdowns and geopolitical instability impacting their export-heavy industries. The eurozone's tepid recovery also cast a shadow, with concerns over deflation and consumer spending remaining high. In France, chief executives were more preoccupied with domestic regulatory burdens and the need for structural reforms to stimulate economic activity. Confidence levels remained subdued across both nations, reflecting a cautious European outlook amidst ongoing economic uncertainties and the lingering effects of the debt crisis.\n\nGlobally, the PwC survey of over 1,300 CEOs highlighted a universal shift towards caution. Beyond Russia's unique challenges stemming from sanctions and falling oil prices, and the UK's specific talent woes, the overall sentiment was one of strategic retrenchment. Only 37% of chief executives globally expected economic improvement, down from 44%. This marked decline underscores a pervasive sense of uncertainty across various regions, influenced by factors ranging from commodity price volatility to geopolitical tensions. CEOs indicated a greater focus on operational efficiency, cost control, and organic growth strategies, with less appetite for aggressive expansion. Investment in innovation, particularly digital technologies, emerged as a key priority to build resilience and secure competitive advantage in a volatile global market.",

The deaths deepened political tensions in Paraguay and were used by congress to oust the left - wing President Fernando Lugo . Four men received sentences of between 18 and 30 years in jail This tragic incident, which unfolded on June 15, 2012, at the Campos Morumbi estate in Curuguaty, became widely known as the Curuguaty Massacre. The land in question was fiercely disputed, with landless farmers claiming it as state property intended for agrarian reform. The subsequent judicial process was highly controversial; human rights organizations and international observers heavily criticized the trial of the eleven farmers, alleging a lack of due process and insufficient evidence linking them to the police deaths.\n\nThe massacre provided the immediate catalyst for the Paraguayan congress to orchestrate a rapid impeachment of President Fernando Lugo. His swift removal, days after the killings, was seen as a politically motivated move to reverse his land reform agenda. Several regional governments, including MERCOSUR and UNASUR, condemned Lugo's ouster as a 'parliamentary coup,' leading to Paraguay's temporary suspension from these blocs.\n\nDespite the initial convictions handed down in 2016, a major turning point occurred in July 2017. The Supreme Court of Justice of Paraguay annulled the sentences against the eleven convicted farmers, including the four, citing a lack of concrete evidence and procedural errors. This landmark decision led to their immediate release, marking a complex legal saga that underscored the deep-seated land conflicts and political polarization in Paraguay.

The Official Charts Company confirmed that this double-top entry is a truly historic moment, reflecting the immense anticipation for new material from the globally adored singer-songwriter.\n\nThe two tracks, 'Shape of You' and 'Castle on the Hill', showcase different facets of Sheeran's musical artistry.

It has struggled since being acquired by private equity firm Greybull Capital in September 2015. The chain, formerly Morrisons M Local, was sold off by the supermarket giant as part of a strategic shift away from smaller convenience formats to focus on its larger superstores. At the time of the sale, Morrisons provided significant financial support to Greybull Capital, including a loan of up to £25 million, to help stabilize the business and facilitate its turnaround. However, the investment proved insufficient to reverse its fortunes in an increasingly competitive market dominated by established players like Tesco Express and Sainsbury's Local, as well as discounters.\n\nThe challenges faced by the former Morrisons' M Local stores under Greybull Capital’s stewardship were multifaceted. High operating costs, coupled with intense price competition and shifts in consumer shopping habits, created a difficult trading environment. Despite efforts to rebrand and reposition the stores as ‘My Local’, aiming for a community-focused offering, the chain failed to gain significant traction or achieve sustainable profitability. The decision to appoint KPMG as administrators came after a period of intense financial pressure, leaving no viable path forward without significant restructuring.\n\nKPMG's immediate priority has been to manage the closure of the 93 unprofitable stores and to seek buyers for the remaining 32. Sources close to the administration process indicate that finding a single buyer for the remaining portfolio might be challenging, suggesting that individual or smaller clusters of stores could be sold off to other retailers or convenience store operators. The closure process will unfortunately result in the loss of a significant number of the 1,658 jobs, though Morrisons' proactive offer to re-employ former My Local staff, where possible, provides some relief to those affected. This gesture by Morrisons highlights its ongoing commitment, having initially established the convenience arm and then divested it.\n\nThe collapse of My Local underscores the difficulties even established players face in the convenience sector. For Greybull Capital, this represents a significant setback, adding to their mixed portfolio of investments. The future of the remaining 32 stores hinges entirely on KPMG’s ability to secure buyers within a reasonable timeframe, failing which, they too will inevitably shut, marking the complete disappearance of the My Local brand from the high street, less than a year after its high-profile launch under Greybull.",

    "sentence": "The collection of images , along with medals and badges , will go on auction later in July . The find \" is like a time capsule that sheds new light on the war \" , auctioneer Charles Hanson said . The photos were taken by Robert Oliver , who survived the brutal realities of the Boer War, serving with distinction as a Royal Army Medical Corps sergeant. His collection, meticulously preserved, offers an unparalleled glimpse into the daily lives of soldiers, the harsh landscapes, and the stark realities of conflict that shaped the early 20th century. Among the items is his coveted Queen's Medal for South Africa, complete with multiple clasps, a testament to his bravery and presence in pivotal campaigns, including those in the Orange Free State. This remarkable archive not only documents his personal journey but also provides vital historical context to the operations of the British Empire during a period of immense geopolitical change. Charles Hanson emphasized that such a comprehensive and personal archive is exceedingly rare, offering historians and collectors a unique opportunity to connect directly with the past. Oliver’s images capture both the grim determination of the troops and unexpected moments of camaraderie and quiet reflection, far removed from the staged photographs often seen from that era. These candid shots, combined with his medals and personal effects, paint a vivid portrait of a man who witnessed history unfold and had the foresight to document it. The sheer depth of the collection, detailing everything from medical tents to troop movements across the veld, makes it an invaluable resource for understanding the human cost and strategic challenges faced by the British forces. It truly is, as Hanson stated, a time capsule, brimming with untold stories and forgotten perspectives that challenge existing narratives of the conflict. The auction is expected to draw international interest due to the rarity and historical significance of Oliver’s contributions to documenting one of the British Empire's most challenging conflicts.",

The signal came through a giant dish in Madrid , Spain - part of a Nasa network of communications antennas . The message took four hours 25 minutes to traverse 4.7 billion km of space . The tension mounted as scientists and engineers at mission headquarters in Laurel , Maryland , waited for telemetry information . So there was joy and relief when the signal was finally confirmed to be robust and filled with precious data. A roar of applause erupted in the mission control room, followed by hugs and back-patting among the weary but elated team members. For years, this moment had been the culmination of relentless effort, meticulous planning, and countless sleepless nights. The successful transmission meant that the spacecraft, after its perilous close encounter, had survived intact and was now sending back the treasure trove of information it had collected.\n\nThe first packets of telemetry confirmed the health of all onboard instruments, including the high-resolution cameras, spectrometers, and magnetometers. Scientists immediately began processing the initial raw data, eager for the first glimpses of the mysterious icy world. This successful flyby represents a pivotal moment in our exploration of the outer solar system, pushing the boundaries of what is possible and offering an unprecedented look at a celestial body previously only dimly observed from afar. The data received promises to revolutionize our understanding of cryogenic geology, potential subsurface oceans, and the conditions necessary for habitability beyond Earth.\n\nMission scientists expect to be sifting through the downloaded information for months, if not years. Each byte of data carries the potential to unlock new secrets about the universe, from the composition of the ice to the potential presence of plumes or geological activity. The incredible journey of the spacecraft, travelling billions of kilometers from Earth, has now yielded its first major reward, validating the ingenuity of the engineers and the dedication of the scientists. This critical 'call home' was not just a technical triumph, but a profound affirmation of humanity's unyielding curiosity and its quest to explore the cosmos. The images and spectral data will provide a wealth of information about the surface features, atmospheric composition (if any), and magnetic field interactions, painting a comprehensive picture of this distant, enigmatic world. The mission team, having overcome the immediate hurdle of the flyby and data transmission, now faces the equally exciting challenge of interpreting what the spacecraft observed and translating those observations into groundbreaking discoveries. This initial success paves the way for deeper analysis and potentially future missions to similar targets, fueled by the insights gained from this remarkable encounter.",

The coroner at a second inquest on Pte Cheryl James , who died at Deepcut in 1995, concluded in 2016 that her death was not suicide but an 'unlawful killing', a landmark overturning of the original finding. Pte James was one of four young soldiers who died from gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, in Surrey, between 1995 and 2002. The others were Private Geoff Gray, Private James Collinson, and Private Kevin Williams. All four deaths were initially ruled as suicides, leading to years of tenacious campaigning by their families, who consistently maintained that the circumstances surrounding their children's deaths were suspicious and that the original investigations were fundamentally flawed.\n\nThe tragic sequence of Deepcut deaths became a national scandal, shining a harsh light on welfare provisions, alleged bullying, and the duty of care within the British Army. Families, often supported by organisations such as Liberty, fought tirelessly to have the original inquest verdicts quashed and new inquiries launched, believing that vital evidence had been overlooked or mishandled. The case of Pte Cheryl James, in particular, gained renewed traction when her parents, Des and Doreen James, secured a fresh inquest following years of arduous legal battles. This second inquest heard compelling evidence of a pervasive culture of fear, harassment, and even alleged sexual exploitation at the barracks, which her family powerfully argued contributed directly to her death.\n\nSimilarly, the family of Pte Sean Benton, also found dead at the same Deepcut Barracks in Surrey, has long sought a new inquest into his death. His sister, Tracy Lewis, and other family members have consistently challenged the original suicide verdict, citing numerous inconsistencies in the evidence and a disturbing lack of proper investigation at the time. The recent consent granted by the Attorney General for Pte Benton's family to apply to the High Court for a fresh inquest underscores the profound and ongoing concerns about the integrity of the original inquiries into these tragic deaths.\n\nThese landmark cases, driven by the extraordinary persistence and courage of the bereaved families and their dedicated legal teams, have had a profound and lasting impact on the understanding of military deaths and the standards of investigation within the armed forces. They have critically highlighted the urgent need for independent oversight and a transparent justice process when service personnel die in non-combat circumstances. The re-examination of these deeply troubling cases, particularly through the High Court and subsequent new inquests, represents a pivotal moment in the collective quest for truth and accountability, offering a glimmer of hope for long-awaited closure to families who have endured decades of anguish and unanswered questions regarding the deaths of their loved ones at Deepcut and similar military establishments.",

In March , the Crown Prosecution Service said there remained \" insufficient evidence to pursue a prosecution against anyone in connection with Jonathan's death. This decision meant that the coroner, Dr. James Adeley, could now resume the inquest into the circumstances surrounding the infant's passing.

James Percival, who claimed to have delivered the baby, maintained that he had attempted to resuscitate the infant, performing mouth-to-mouth and chest compressions. He described the baby as being born \"blue\" and not breathing, prompting his immediate intervention. However, Ruth Percival, the child's mother, presented a vastly different narrative.

Her testimony cast serious doubt on his account of the events leading up to the baby's death.\n\nThe new medical evidence that prompted the coroner to involve prosecutors was not publicly detailed but was understood to have raised specific questions about the circumstances of Jonathan's death and the care he received. Despite this, the CPS concluded that the evidential threshold for criminal charges could not be met. The family of Jonathan Percival, including Ruth Percival, expressed their ongoing desire for a full understanding of what happened to the newborn. The resumed inquest was expected to hear further expert medical testimony and revisit the conflicting accounts from James Percival and Ruth Percival, with the coroner's ultimate goal being to provide a definitive conclusion on the cause and circumstances of Jonathan's tragic death in Freckleton, Lancashire.

All players are expected to be available from the very beginning.\" This firm stance highlights Gatland's unwavering commitment to player availability for the crucial tour preparations, which he views as non-negotiable for team cohesion and strategic development. The Lions squad, including key figures like Halfpenny, is due to assemble for their pre-tour camp on May 22, just under two weeks before the proposed Top 14 final. For Gatland, every moment of preparation is invaluable, especially with a demanding schedule of ten matches, including three Tests against the world champions, New Zealand.\n\nThe head coach has consistently emphasised that the integrity of the Lions tour takes absolute precedence, and that all selected players must be fully committed and present for the duration of the build-up. This policy has been a clear one from the start of the selection process. The coaching staff believes that any early absences would severely compromise the team’s ability to gel and perform at the elite level required to challenge the All Blacks on their home turf. Halfpenny, renowned for his defensive prowess, accurate goal-kicking, and strong counter-attacking game, is considered a vital component of Gatland's plans. His experience from previous Lions tours, particularly the victorious 2013 series in Australia, makes his early integration into the squad even more paramount. Richard Cockerill's attempts to secure Leigh Halfpenny’s release for such a significant club fixture are understandable from Toulon's perspective. However, Gatland's firm refusal reinforces the unique status and demands of the British & Irish Lions tour, which operates outside the usual club-versus-country dynamics.

    "sentence": "Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have spoken of the risks of moving patients hundreds of miles . The warning comes as the results of a serious case review into the abuse of patients at the private hospital near Bristol are due to be released . The abuse was uncovered during secret filming by the BBC Panorama programme . Eleven people have admitted charges of ill - treatment and neglect related to the abuse . South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board ( SAB ) commissioned the review , carried out by an independent investigator. The review meticulously examined the systemic failures allowing horrific abuse at Winterbourne View, the private hospital near Bristol. It delved into circumstances leading to patients being placed far from families and communities, a key concern highlighted by Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation. Their long-standing campaigns consistently warned against inherent risks of distant placements, which isolate vulnerable individuals, hinder family visits, and create environments where neglect and abuse are less likely to be detected.\n\nThe serious case review, commissioned by the SAB, sought to identify not only direct perpetrators but also broader institutional and commissioning failures. It scrutinised oversight mechanisms, or lack thereof, from local authorities and NHS trusts responsible for patient placement at Winterbourne View. Findings are expected to be stark, revealing how a system designed to protect vulnerable adults failed them catastrophically. The BBC Panorama exposé, using secret filming to uncover shocking abuse, served as a crucial catalyst, forcing a national reckoning with care quality for people with learning disabilities and challenging behaviour in residential settings.\n\nThe eleven individuals who admitted charges related to ill-treatment and neglect represent a tragic failure of individual responsibility, but the review's scope goes far beyond individual culpability. It aims to provide recommendations to prevent such atrocities. These are anticipated to include a significant shift away from large institutional placements towards smaller, community-based care closer to homes and families. Strong calls are likely for improved regulation, robust inspection regimes, and enhanced staff training. Furthermore, the review is expected to highlight the critical need for better communication between care providers, commissioning bodies, and families, ensuring concerns are heard and acted upon promptly.\n\nMencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have advocated for comprehensive reform, pushing for person-centred care prioritizing individual rights, dignity, and access to a full life within their community. Their warnings about perils of out-of-area placements, often driven by lack of appropriate local provision or cost-saving, have been tragically vindicated by Winterbourne View. The SAB's commitment to releasing the full findings of this independent review demonstrates a crucial step towards transparency and accountability. Lessons from this harrowing episode must drive genuine, lasting change across health and social care sectors, ensuring safeguarding of vulnerable adults remains paramount. The imperative is to learn from systemic failures and implement robust measures to protect those who rely on specialist care, preventing any recurrence of neglect and abuse. The review's findings will undoubtedly inform national policy and practice, reinforcing the urgent need for a fundamental shift in how care is commissioned and delivered for individuals with complex needs, moving from isolated institutional settings towards inclusive, community-based support.",

    "sentence": "The decision was taken despite the 26 - year - old running the Olympic qualifying time on six occasions and coming third in the trials . \" I accept I will never win an Olympic medal , \" she wrote on eightlane.org . UK Athletics said they do not respond to individual selection decisions, a stance that has often led to frustration among athletes vying for Olympic berths. The 26-year-old athlete in question was Shelayna Oskan-Clarke, whose omission from the initial women's 800m squad for the Games sparked considerable debate within the athletics community. Despite her consistent form and meeting the stringent qualifying standard multiple times, Oskan-Clarke's third-place finish at the national trials did not guarantee her a spot, as UK Athletics' selection policy allows for discretionary picks beyond the top two automatic qualifiers. This controversial approach meant that while Lynsey Sharp, another strong contender, secured her place, the final slot remained a point of contention. Oskan-Clarke’s powerful statement on eightlane.org highlighted the immense psychological toll such uncertainty and perceived injustice can take on athletes who dedicate their lives to their sport. Her public lament resonated with many who felt the selection process lacked transparency and fairness, especially given her demonstrated ability to compete at the highest level. The incident underscored ongoing concerns about the subjective nature of some selection criteria, which can leave athletes feeling vulnerable and disempowered, their Olympic dreams hinging on decisions that often seem inexplicable. While UK Athletics maintains its right to select the strongest possible team, the lack of detailed explanations for controversial omissions continues to be a source of tension between the governing body and its athletes.",

The warning of ice and snow falling to about an inch ( 4 cm ) on ground will persist throughout the day, particularly impacting higher ground and untreated surfaces. The Met Office has advised that these conditions are likely to lead to some difficult driving conditions on many routes across Aberdeenshire, central Scotland, and the Highlands. Motorists are urged to exercise extreme caution, allow extra time for journeys, and consider if their travel is essential. Particular concern has been raised for major arteries such as the A9, A90, and the A82, where strong winds could also lead to drifting snow and reduced visibility, making conditions treacherous. Public transport services, including bus and rail, may also experience delays or cancellations as a result of the challenging weather. Local authorities in Scotland are working to ensure priority routes are gritted, but secondary roads and rural areas are expected to be most affected. The yellow warning is expected to remain in place until at least midnight on Friday, with further updates from the Met Office anticipated as the situation develops. Residents in affected areas are encouraged to check local news and weather forecasts regularly for the latest information and to prepare for potential disruptions to daily routines. Schools in some remote parts of Aberdeenshire have already announced closures or delayed openings.

An Afghanistan Cricket Board ( ACB ) statement it could not agree to play against \" a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe havens \" . The Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) later accused the ACB of \" playing politics \" . Pakistan has rejected an Afghan claim that it was involved the attack The unprecedented decision by the Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) to halt cricketing ties underscores escalating diplomatic tensions between Kabul and Islamabad. This dramatic move threatens to derail a planned T20 series and future bilateral engagements, as the ACB declared it could not play against \"a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe havens.\" The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) quickly hit back, accusing the ACB of \"playing politics\" and lamenting the politicization of sports. \"Cricket should unite people, not divide them,\" a PCB official reportedly stated, emphasizing the sport's traditional spirit.\n\nThe PCB further highlighted its historical role in nurturing Afghan talent, with many Afghan cricketers gaining crucial experience through Pakistan's domestic leagues and the Pakistan Super League (PSL). This cricketing bridge, built over years of shared passion, now appears severely damaged. From Afghanistan's perspective, however, the direct link established by its intelligence agencies between the recent attack and elements allegedly operating from Pakistani soil makes normal sporting exchanges untenable. The ACB’s statement reflects a broader national sentiment demanding accountability and an end to what Kabul views as cross-border terrorism. The Afghan government has consistently accused Islamabad of supporting militant groups that destabilize Afghanistan, a charge Pakistan vehemently denies, asserting its own struggles with terrorism originating from across the border.\n\nThe impasse poses a significant challenge for the future of cricket between the two nations. The diplomatic fallout from the attack is thus casting a long shadow over any prospects of immediate reconciliation, not just in politics but also on the cricket field. The Afghanistan Cricket Board’s defiant stance, backed by the Afghan government, signals that until Afghanistan perceives a tangible shift in Islamabad's policy regarding alleged militant safe havens, the sporting arena will remain inextricably linked to their deeply entrenched political grievances. The Pakistan Cricket Board continues to advocate for the separation of sports and politics, but without a resolution to the underlying security concerns, the future of cricket between these passionate rivals remains highly uncertain.",

SSI UK Business Director Cornelius Louwrens said the move was 'extremely disappointing' but 'absolutely essential' given the challenging market conditions. He emphasized that the decision was taken to preserve the long-term viability of the business, exploring all options for its future. The Redcar plant, a symbol of industrial heritage in the North East, now faces an uncertain future, sparking fears for the jobs of its almost 2,000 workers and the wider supply chain.

The Investigatory Powers Act gained royal assent in November . The government has said it will defend the act . Powers covered by the act allow state agencies to control and alter electronic devices , read texts , online messages and emails, monitor phone calls and access location data. This controversial legislation, dubbed the 'Snooper's Charter' by critics, grants extensive surveillance capabilities to agencies like MI5, MI6, and GCHQ. Liberty, with director Martha Spurrier at the forefront, argues the act constitutes an \"assault on our freedom\" by enabling mass surveillance. Spurrier contends it permits indiscriminate data collection on ordinary citizens, setting a dangerous precedent for civil liberties rather than targeting specific threats. She calls it one of the most extreme surveillance laws in a democracy. Despite significant opposition, including from the House of Lords which sought stronger privacy protections, the Investigatory Powers Act gained royal assent. The government, under then-Prime Minister Theresa May, defended the act as vital for national security in the digital age. May argued it merely updated existing powers, bringing transparency and proper oversight through independent judicial commissioners. However, Liberty and other privacy advocates continue to challenge its proportionality. They highlight concerns over bulk data collection, device hacking, and the requirement for internet service providers to retain browsing history for 12 months, viewing these as unacceptable intrusions.

    "sentence": "The fine print of the deal suggests something slightly different , and shows that GM has in fact taken a hit of up to ¬£6bn in order to get shot of Vauxhall and Opel . First , a big chunk of the price - three - quarters of a billion pounds - is not for car plants , but for loans taken out by the owners of Opel and Vauxhall This unusual arrangement highlights that rather than simply selling an asset, GM is effectively paying to divest itself of a long-standing financial burden. The bulk of the £6bn charge, however, stems from the substantial pension liabilities that GM has chosen to retain rather than offload to Peugeot. Estimates place GM's retention of pension obligations for Vauxhall and Opel employees at well over £5bn, reflecting the enormous cost of legacy commitments built up over decades. This decision, made in Detroit, underscores GM's strategic imperative to clear its balance sheet of European losses that have plagued its financial performance for years. By retaining these liabilities, GM avoids the potentially complex and protracted negotiations that would have been required to transfer them to Peugeot, thereby expediting the sale and providing a clean break.\n\nThe deal, therefore, is less about GM selling a profitable division and more about a costly exit from a market where it has struggled to compete consistently. For Peugeot, this acquisition of Vauxhall and Opel presents an opportunity to significantly increase its market share in Europe and achieve substantial economies of scale. However, it also means inheriting a business that has been unprofitable for nearly two decades, requiring significant restructuring and investment to turn around. The challenge for Peugeot will be to integrate the Vauxhall and Opel operations efficiently, streamline production, and reduce costs without alienating the workforce or diluting the brands' appeal. The focus for Vauxhall under its new ownership will be on platform sharing with Peugeot models, standardizing components, and rationalizing the product portfolio to improve profitability. This move signals a definitive shift in GM's global strategy, allowing it to concentrate resources on more lucrative markets like North America and China, and invest heavily in future technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. The severance of ties with Vauxhall and Opel frees up capital and management attention, enabling GM to pursue its growth ambitions elsewhere, even if the price of freedom came with a hefty £6bn cheque.",

    "sentence": "Andreea Cristea is the fifth victim of the attack on 22 March , in which Khalid Masood drove into crowds on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman to death , before being shot dead himself . Ms Cristea , 31 , who was on holiday with boyfriend Andrei Burnaz , had been in hospital since the attack . It has emerged that Mr Burnaz had been planning to propose during the day out . A family statement confirmed Ms Cristea , who was an architect , had died on Thursday . The architect, who had been visiting London from Romania, was thrown into the River Thames during the rampage by Khalid Masood. She was rescued from the water but had suffered catastrophic head injuries and a severe lung infection, remaining in critical condition for weeks at St Thomas' Hospital. Her family, including her parents and sister, had maintained a constant vigil at her bedside, desperately hoping for her recovery, until her tragic passing.\n\nMr Burnaz, who sustained a fractured foot in the attack and has since undergone surgery, has spoken emotionally about the terrifying moments after they were hit and his desperate search for Andreea amidst the chaos. He described seeing Ms Cristea disappear into the water after being struck by the vehicle, and his frantic efforts to locate her before she was pulled out by rescuers. The couple, originally from Constanța, Romania, were on a romantic trip, and the revelation that Mr Burnaz had intended to propose adds a profoundly tragic layer to their story, highlighting the dreams and future abruptly stolen by the act of terror.\n\nMs Cristea's death tragically brings the total number of fatalities directly resulting from Khalid Masood's attack to five. The other victims were US tourist Kurt Cochran, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, and mother-of-two Aysha Frade, all of whom were struck on Westminster Bridge, along with PC Keith Palmer, the brave officer stabbed to death by Masood at the gates of the Palace of Westminster. The attack, which stunned the world, transformed a bustling London landmark into a scene of unimaginable horror and grief.\n\nTributes have poured in for Andreea, remembering her as a vibrant, talented architect with a promising future. The Romanian Ambassador to the UK expressed deep sorrow, conveying the shared grief of the Romanian community for her loss. Her tragic passing is a stark reminder of the global reach of such violence, impacting individuals from diverse backgrounds who were simply enjoying a day out in a major capital. The investigation into Masood’s motives and potential associates continues, but the devastating human cost of his actions, epitomized by Ms Cristea and Mr Burnaz, remains the most poignant legacy. London, a city known for its enduring spirit and resilience, mourns its lost, but remains united against the hatred that seeks to divide it.",

But ex - champion Klitschko , who fights Fury in Manchester on 9 July , said : \" I was in shock at his statements . \" When I heard about the video, I found it incredibly disturbing,\" the Ukrainian fighter continued, clearly upset. \"As a professional athlete, you have a responsibility to be a role model. To use your platform for such hateful rhetoric, especially anti-Semitic comments that evoke dark periods of history, is simply unacceptable. It goes against everything sport should represent.\" Klitschko, himself from a nation that suffered immensely during World War II, expressed deep concern about the impact such statements could have.\n\nFury’s controversial remarks had drawn widespread condemnation across Britain, leading to calls for his license to be revoked. His anti-Semitic tirade, in which he claimed \"Zionist, Jewish people... own all the banks, all the palaces, all the world,\" caused profound offence, echoing historical prejudices. His previous sexist and homophobic comments also resurfaced, painting a picture of ingrained bigotry. The Campaign Against Antisemitism, a prominent UK watchdog, was particularly vocal, calling for decisive action against the British boxer. They emphasized the danger of hateful speech from high-profile athletes, especially when it mirrors rhetoric associated with figures like Hitler, stressing the need for public figures to grasp the gravity of their words. Klitschko added, \"This isn't just about boxing anymore. This is about basic human decency and respect.\" He stressed that while the fight was imminent, Fury’s actions had transcended the sport, raising serious questions about a champion's values. The immense backlash forced Fury to issue an apology, which many found insincere, only fueling the controversy.",

Jacques Rudolph 's wait for a first Championship hundred in 2016 continued as he chopped onto his stumps for 56 . Earlier , Essex had been bowled out for 319 , with Craig Meschede ( 5 - 84 ) taking his first five - wicket haul in first-class cricket for Glamorgan. His accurate seam bowling ripped through the Essex middle order, claiming the crucial scalps of Simon Harmer and Neil Wagner as Essex were dismissed for 319. Earlier, Alastair Cook had made a patient 90, but Meschede's spell truly restricted Essex.\n\nGlamorgan began their second innings with a 26-run deficit. Openers Nick Selman (41) and Jacques Rudolph built a steady platform. Rudolph, despite his eventual dismissal, looked largely untroubled for much of his 125-ball stay, striking seven boundaries. His uncharacteristic lapse saw him drag a delivery from Jamie Porter onto his stumps, ending his aspirations of a century. His departure at 110 for 2 brought Marnus Labuschagne (28) to the crease, who was then trapped lbw by Sam Cook. The Glamorgan middle order faced a testing period. Chris Cooke battled for his 35, and Kiran Carlson added 22, but wickets fell regularly as Essex bowlers exploited the variable bounce. A late cameo from Ryan Thomas, who hit a valuable 18 not out, helped extend the lead as the light faded. The visitors will hope their tailenders can add valuable runs on day four to set Essex a challenging target, with the pitch showing signs of wear and tear, promising more assistance for the spinners. Rudolph's earlier efforts, alongside Meschede's disciplined bowling, have put Glamorgan in a strong position, but the final day promises to be tense. The match remains finely poised, with Glamorgan holding the upper hand thanks to their consistent batting and Meschede's destructive spell.",

Hayley Murdoch , 29 , and Sheila Dixon , 71 , both from Carlisle , died following the collision at Newby Cross in 2016 . Dr Laura Duffy called Logan , years after that harrowing day, to marvel at his incredible journey back to health. She vividly recalled the scene at Newby Cross, describing it as one of the most challenging she had ever encountered. Logan had been clinically dead, but through the swift, coordinated efforts of the emergency services – the first responders, paramedics, and the air ambulance crew – he was resuscitated at the roadside. He was then airlifted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle in a critical condition, placed in an induced coma, and remained there for several weeks, fighting for his life. His family, already reeling from the devastating loss of Hayley Murdoch and Sheila Dixon, braced themselves for the worst, enduring agonizing days and nights by his bedside.\n\nAgainst all odds, Logan began a slow, arduous recovery. Dr Duffy recounted the initial prognosis, which had been bleak, suggesting severe brain damage and long-term disability were highly probable. Yet, Logan’s resilience and determination, coupled with exceptional medical care, defied these expectations. His rehabilitation was extensive, involving months of physiotherapy, speech therapy, and psychological support to help him come to terms with the traumatic event and the profound grief of losing his mother and grandmother. The call from Dr Duffy was a poignant reminder of how close he came to joining them. She told him that his survival was nothing short of miraculous, a testament to the life-saving work done in those critical moments at the crash site near Carlisle. Logan, now a vocal advocate for the Great North Air Ambulance, often reflects on that day, acknowledging that without their rapid response, he would not be here today to share his story or remember his beloved Hayley Murdoch and Sheila Dixon. The scars, both physical and emotional, remain, but so does an immense gratitude for the second chance at life he received.",

Jurors previously heard she was concerned 21 - month - old Ayeeshia Jane Smith may have had a seizure after taking drugs kept at the house . Ms Smith and ex - partner Matthew Rigby both deny murder . More on this and other stories from Stoke and Staffordshire The toddler , known as AJ , died in 2014 at the family home in St Giles Road, Burton-upon-Trent, following what the prosecution described as a \"terrible assault\". The court heard that AJ suffered \"catastrophic\" injuries, including a lacerated heart and internal bleeding, consistent with a severe impact. Post-mortem examinations revealed that Ayeeshia Jane Smith also had historic injuries, including a previous brain bleed and fractures to her ribs, consistent with her having been subjected to non-accidental harm on more than one occasion before her death.\n\nOpening the prosecution's case, Christopher Hotten QC told the jury that both Ms Smith, 23, and Matthew Rigby, 21, were responsible for the fatal injuries inflicted upon AJ. He alleged that the couple, who were in a volatile relationship, had engaged in a \"joint enterprise\" to inflict serious harm, or that one had caused the injuries while the other failed to protect the child. The jury was presented with evidence of a chaotic household where drug use, including cannabis, was prevalent. Ms Smith's admission about using her limited income support to fund drug purchases underlined the difficult environment AJ was living in. The prosecution highlighted texts and calls between Ms Smith and Rigby in the hours leading up to AJ's death, which painted a picture of tension and concern about AJ's health, specifically the worry that she may have ingested drugs.\n\nDuring cross-examination, Ms Smith maintained her innocence, accusing Matthew Rigby of being the one who inflicted the fatal injuries. She claimed she had briefly left the room and returned to find AJ unresponsive. Conversely, Rigby's defence team argued that it was Ms Smith who was responsible, suggesting she had a history of losing her temper and being violent. The court heard conflicting accounts from both defendants, each attempting to shift blame onto the other. Social services had been involved with the family prior to AJ's death, and concerns about the child's welfare had been raised on multiple occasions. Evidence presented included records of these interventions and assessments. The trial, presided over by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave at Stafford Crown Court, continues to hear from medical experts, police officers, and other witnesses who were involved in the investigation. The jury's task is to determine who was responsible for the tragic death of Ayeeshia Jane Smith, considering the complex web of evidence and conflicting narratives presented by the defence and prosecution. The deeply distressing nature of the case, involving a young child, has drawn significant public attention to the proceedings.",

Having missed a penalty , awarded for Garath McCleary 's foul on Ben Mee , Rodriguez then headed his second from another Trippier cross . On - loan Wolves man Adlene Guedioura went closest for the visitors, rattling the crossbar with a powerful long-range effort early in the second half. Despite their spirited efforts, Wolves struggled to find a way past Burnley's resolute defence, marshalled expertly by Ben Mee. The home side, buoyed by Rodriguez's brace, controlled much of the possession in the midfield, with Trippier continuing to be a menace down the right flank, his delivery a constant threat.\n\nBurnley’s dominance was evident, and they continued to press for a third goal to put the game beyond doubt. Scott Arfield and George Boyd worked tirelessly on the wings, creating space for the full-backs to push forward. Trippier, in particular, seemed to be enjoying one of his most influential performances of the season, his crosses causing panic in the Wolves penalty area time and again. However, Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme pulled off several key saves to deny Burnley further additions to the scoreline, including a superb stop from a fierce Rodriguez volley that would have completed his hat-trick.\n\nAs the game wore on, Wolves pushed higher, desperate to find a goal that would reignite their hopes. Garath McCleary, who had been involved in the early penalty incident, tried to make amends with some penetrating runs, but his efforts were largely isolated. Burnley’s backline, with Mee at its heart, stood firm against the late pressure. Manager Sean Dyche made tactical substitutions to shore up the midfield and defence, bringing on fresh legs to maintain their high work rate. The final whistle blew with Burnley securing a comfortable 2-0 victory, a result that reflected their superior attacking prowess and defensive solidity. Rodriguez's clinical finishing, combined with Kieran Trippier's exceptional service, proved to be the decisive factors in a commanding performance by the Clarets. The win saw Burnley climb further up the Championship table, consolidating their position as serious promotion contenders. Wolves, meanwhile, were left to ponder a missed opportunity on the road.",

    "sentence": "It is understood the Hammers will raise their offer for the player who began his career at the east London club . Defoe , 34 , has scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for the Premier League strugglers this season . His latest goals came on Monday as Sunderland twice fought from a goal deficit to draw 2-2 with Liverpool at the Stadium of Light. Defoe's two penalties highlighted his undiminished quality and vital importance to David Moyes' struggling side. Despite their precarious Premier League position, Sunderland are resolute in their stance that Defoe is not for sale. Moyes has repeatedly emphasized that losing their prolific scorer would severely jeopardise their survival hopes, particularly given how indispensable he has been to their attack.\n\nWest Ham's pursuit, however, remains persistent. Manager Slaven Bilic is keen to secure a proven goalscorer, as the Hammers have suffered from inconsistent attacking performances and injuries this season. Bringing a player of Defoe's calibre and Premier League experience back to the London Stadium is seen as a key move to bolster their ambitions. The reported increased offer from the east London club is said to be around £6 million, but Sunderland are understood to value him considerably higher, closer to £10-12 million, reflecting his irreplaceable status. Defoe himself has maintained focus on his on-field commitments, embodying dedication to the Black Cats. His current priority is unequivocally keeping Sunderland in the top flight, a monumental task he has largely spearheaded. This transfer saga is expected to continue until the window closes, with West Ham anticipated to test Sunderland's resolve further, even as the Black Cats stand firm on their 'not for sale' position regarding their talisman.",

It should have been an easy try , but the Wales international , known for his relentless defensive work and never-say-die attitude, launched himself forward with a desperate lunge. The stadium, filled with passionate Italian fans roaring for Treviso, held its breath as Williams, defying the odds, somehow managed to get a hand to Senioli's ankle just inches from the try-line. The Treviso player stumbled, his momentum broken, and the ball, which he had been cradling loosely in anticipation of the score, was dislodged. It bounced once, tantalisingly close to the whitewash, before a Scarlets forward, arriving belatedly but opportunistically, dived on it, securing the turnover. The collective groan from the Italian crowd was almost as loud as the roar of relief from the small contingent of travelling Welsh supporters. Senioli, still sprawled on the turf, looked up in disbelief, the earlier smile replaced by a grimace of frustration. Scott Williams, quickly back on his feet, simply nodded, a silent testament to the high stakes of this cross-border encounter. This single moment, a testament to Williams's grit, shifted the momentum. Treviso, who had been dominating, suddenly looked rattled, while Scarlets, buoyed by the miraculous defensive stop, found a new surge of energy. The game, critical for both sides' European aspirations, hung finely in the balance, a true showcase of the intensity of rugby between Italy and Wales.",

    "sentence": "The weapon was one of a pair of daggers discovered by British archaeologist Howard Carter in 1925 within the burial wrappings of the teenaged king . The origin of its unrusted iron blade has baffled scientists because such metalwork was rare in ancient Egypt . Tutankhamun was mummified more than 3,300 years ago . Italian and Egyptian researchers used \" a non - invasive X - ray technique \" to confirm that the iron blade was indeed of extraterrestrial origin, likely from a meteorite. The study, published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, analyzed the blade's elemental composition, revealing high levels of nickel and cobalt, elements typically found in iron meteorites but rare in terrestrial iron. This groundbreaking finding provided a definitive answer to a long-standing archaeological mystery that had puzzled experts since Howard Carter’s initial discovery of the dagger in Tutankhamun's tomb.\n\nThe sophisticated X-ray fluorescence analysis, conducted by researchers from the Polytechnic University of Milan and the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, eliminated any doubt about the blade's celestial source. The presence of nickel, in particular, was a key indicator, as iron extracted from ores on Earth rarely contains such high concentrations. This suggests that ancient Egyptian metallurgists, despite their advanced skills in working with gold and copper, utilized this unique, readily available raw material from the sky. The fact that the dagger has remained largely uncorroded for over three millennia further supports its meteoric origin, as meteoric iron is often more resistant to rust due to its unique crystalline structure and composition.\n\nThis discovery sheds new light on the technological capabilities and available resources in ancient Egypt during the New Kingdom period. It implies that the Egyptians were not only aware of falling 'sky-iron' but also possessed the skills to forge it into intricate objects of immense value, fit for a pharaoh like Tutankhamun. The cultural significance of such a material, literally descended from the heavens, would have been profound, adding to the mystique and power attributed to the young king. The other dagger found alongside it was made of gold, contrasting sharply with the 'celestial' iron one, highlighting the distinct and perhaps revered nature of the iron blade. This research emphasizes the interdisciplinary approach needed to unravel the secrets of ancient civilizations, combining archaeology, art history, and modern scientific analysis to provide unprecedented insights into the past of Tut and his people.",

The government chief whip was seen with a massive grin after tonight 's vote . Remember ministers ' climbdown came with a clever kicker , persuading Labour to sign up to their timetable for triggering Article 50 without committing to very much in return The 'clever kicker' was the government’s commitment to publish a Brexit white paper and allow a parliamentary debate on the negotiating strategy before Article 50 is invoked. This strategic concession offered vital political cover for Labour MPs, particularly those representing pro-remain constituencies. It enabled them to vote for the timetable, framing their support as a push for parliamentary scrutiny rather than capitulation to Theresa May’s agenda. This allowed them to appease concerned constituents and avoid accusations of obstructing the democratic will.\n\nFor Theresa May, this parliamentary triumph is paramount. It solidifies her authority over the Brexit process, demonstrating her ability to command a Commons majority for her timeline. The chief whip’s satisfaction signalled successful navigation of perilous political currents, momentarily silencing critics. This outcome strengthens May’s hand for complex negotiations with the EU, reinforcing her narrative that the UK is united in its resolve to leave by the deadline. The focus now shifts decisively from the mechanism of triggering Article 50 to defining Britain's future relationship with Europe.\n\nHowever, deep divisions persist. While Labour’s leadership found a pragmatic way through, many within the party and the broader remain camp remain uneasy. The white paper offers limited real parliamentary power over final Brexit terms. Pro-remain voices will undoubtedly intensify as the immense complexities of disentangling from the EU become clearer, especially regarding single market and customs union access. The coming months will severely test the government’s resolve and party cohesion as Brexit’s true impact unfolds. This vote merely concludes the first chapter, ushering in the far more challenging phase of withdrawal and negotiation.",
