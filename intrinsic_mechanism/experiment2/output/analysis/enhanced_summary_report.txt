TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS INTERPRETATION:

The trajectory analysis shows how text samples move through semantic space
across paraphrasing iterations. Key insights:

1. CENTROID MOVEMENT:
   - Tracks how the 'center of mass' of each iteration shifts
   - Large movements indicate significant semantic drift
   - Consistent direction suggests systematic bias in paraphrasing

2. DISTANCE ANALYSIS:
   - Sequential distances show step-by-step semantic changes
   - Increasing trend suggests accelerating semantic drift
   - Decreasing trend suggests convergence to a stable state

3. VARIANCE EXPLAINED:
   - Higher PC1/PC2 variance indicates more structured semantic space
   - Low variance suggests high-dimensional, complex relationships
