WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,84,"That is according to new figures from Northern Ireland Screen, which has provided production funding for the HBO series.
The programme, some of which is filmed in Northern Ireland, has been nominated for 24 Emmy awards.
Two of those nominations are for Northern Ireland production crew members.
Ronan Hill, who won an Emmy in 2012, has been nominated again for outstanding sound mixing for a drama, while Carla Stronge has been nominated for outstanding casting for a drama.
Northern Ireland Screen has invested ¬£12.45m in the series since it began in 2010.
For that investment, it is estimated that ¬£110.7m has been spent on goods and services in the Northern Ireland economy.
From 2010-14, Game of Thrones brought in between ¬£21m and ¬£23m a year to Northern Ireland. Those figures have been audited.
In 2014-15, in which series five of Game of Thrones was filmed, NI Screen invested ¬£1.6m in the programme, and the return that created is estimated at ¬£22m.
Game of Thrones is filmed at the Titanic Studios in Belfast, and many other locations across Northern Ireland.
Many local companies are involved in providing services when the series is in production, and sites from the show have become tourist attractions.
Damian Carr, from Game of Thrones Tours, said fans come from all over the world to visit the filming locations.
""We've had people from North and South America, all over Asia - China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan - and all across Europe.
""We started off running one tour a week; now we're running five.""
Richard Williams, chief executive of NI Screen, said Game of Thrones had established Northern Ireland as a world-class location for film and TV production.
""Additionally, films and television programmes have a significant, positive effect on tourism; they contribute to a wider 'branding' of people, society and culture, all of which has a very strong influence on creating a desire to travel.
""There is no doubt that Game of Thrones is spearheading this set-jetting phenomenon and we have made no secret of the fact that we hope the show will do for Northern Ireland what Lord of the Rings did for New Zealand,"" he said.",0,0,True

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,277,"Fourteen-year-old Ahmed Mohamed, an aspiring inventor, was taken into custody at MacArthur High School in Irving, Texas, after school staff and administrators mistakenly identified his self-made clock as a dangerous device. He had simply intended to present his invention to his engineering instructor. However, the visible circuit board and wires housed within a pencil box resulted in his immediate apprehension, questioning without his parents present, fingerprinting, and eventual transfer to a juvenile detention facility. This event quickly escalated, attracting widespread media attention both nationally and internationally, and prompting significant discussions about Islamophobia and racial profiling.

The incident triggered an instant and immense public outcry. Influential figures, such as then-President Barack Obama and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, publicly expressed their support, leading to invitations for Ahmed to visit the White House and Facebook headquarters. The hashtag #IStandWithAhmed gained global traction, underscoring worries regarding excessive responses and prejudice in educational disciplinary actions. Ahmed's charges were swiftly dropped, and his apprehension drew broad condemnation.

The ordeal profoundly unsettled Ahmed's father, Mohamed El-Hassan Mohamed. He was convinced that the school's conduct was rooted in discrimination and Islamophobia, which led him to withdraw all his children from the local school district. The family later moved to Qatar following Ahmed's scholarship offer, before eventually returning to the United States. Ultimately, this event emerged as a significant touchstone in continuing discussions about inherent biases within both the education system and law enforcement agencies.",1,0,False

Sheeran's comeback follows a ""gap year"" where he removed himself from social media, making space to write his third album, √É¬∑ (Divide).
Fans were clearly hungry for new material, as the star set several streaming records over the course of the week.
Shape Of You's bouncy, uptempo pop was the bigger hit, notching up 13.4 million streams - smashing the record Drake set last summer, when One Dance was streamed 8.9 million in a single week.
Castle On The Hill, built around a chiming, U2-style guitar riff, also beat Drake's tally, with 11.07 million streams.
On Spotify, Sheeran also broke a global streaming record held by One Direction, whose single Drag Me Down racked up 4.76m streams in one day in August 2015.
Shape Of You was streamed 6.13 million times when it was released last Friday, increasing to 7.24 million streams on Monday.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,325,"Northern Ireland Screen (NIS), the organization funding the acclaimed HBO series, has reported that the show, which was partly filmed in Northern Ireland, received an impressive 24 Emmy nominations. Notably, two of these prestigious awards recognize local production professionals. Ronan Hill, an Emmy recipient in 2012, secured another nomination for outstanding sound mixing in a drama, and Carla Stronge was nominated for outstanding casting for the popular HBO production. These accolades strongly highlight the profound expertise within Northern Ireland's flourishing screen sector and bolster the region's increasing reputation as a significant global center for film and television.

NIS, an agency committed to advancing the film, television, and animation industries, has made substantial financial contributions that have been pivotal in drawing major international projects, such as this HBO series, to the area. This targeted funding offers crucial monetary aid and concurrently aids in building a resilient infrastructure and a highly skilled local workforce, thereby cementing Northern Ireland's standing as a prime filming location for significant productions.

The remarkable total of 24 Emmy nominations received by the series stands as unequivocal evidence of the successful partnership between global studios and Northern Irish professionals. It underscores the wide array of talents available throughout Northern Ireland, spanning specializations from sound engineering and casting to set design and visual effects. The individual recognition of Ronan Hill, a seasoned Emmy laureate, and Carla Stronge, a leading expert in casting, particularly brings to light the exceptional, world-class capabilities thriving within Northern Ireland's production sector. Their achievements showcase the consistently high caliber maintained across all stages of cinematic creation.

Richard Williams, Northern Ireland Screen's Chief Executive, conveyed immense satisfaction regarding these nominations. He voiced his pleasure at observing the outstanding contributions of local crew members gain recognition on such a distinguished international platform. Williams further remarked that Ronan and Carla's well-deserved nominations illuminate the extraordinary talent pool in Northern Ireland. He went on to assert that the ongoing triumph of the HBO series, parts of which were expertly shot amidst the region's stunning scenery, demonstrates Northern Ireland's substantial influence on worldwide entertainment. He concluded by stating that NIS's unwavering dedication to cultivating and backing the local screen industry consistently yields beneficial results, such as drawing in foreign investment, generating employment, and elevating the region's global standing.

Shooting portions of the series in Northern Ireland has delivered substantial economic advantages, resulting in considerable expenditure within the local economy across services, lodging, and diverse businesses. Moreover, it has created widespread employment prospects for hundreds of production and support staff. This continuous narrative of achievement validates Northern Ireland Screen's enduring objective: to cultivate a strong and dynamic creative sector capable of producing world-class material and competing internationally. The forthcoming Emmy Awards ceremony is eagerly awaited by all participants, especially the committed Northern Irish crew whose input has significantly elevated the series' artistic merit and broad appeal. The influence of such prominent productions extends beyond purely financial metrics, nurturing local pride and motivating future generations of cinematographers and creative experts. This persistent trajectory of development and global acknowledgment solidly establishes Northern Ireland as a crucial participant in the international entertainment arena, propelled by its distinctive locales, proficient personnel, and active backing from bodies like Northern Ireland Screen. These nominations unequivocally confirm the outstanding quality of work and the promising outlook for the province's creative sphere.",1,1,True

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,787,"The Dolphin Women's Institute (WI) in Braintree has completed an intricate series of knitted models, faithfully reproducing several of the town's most iconic landmarks, such as its church and museum. Each model, standing approximately 45 cm (18 inches) tall, features a meticulously crafted knitted exterior covering a polystyrene or cardboard core. This distinctive project was conceived to capture Braintree's essence through these miniature architectural representations. The initiative first arose during the lockdown periods, providing members with a shared objective and a creative outlet.

Under the direction of Elaine Pye, a seasoned member and accomplished knitter, the team carefully identified key structures that symbolize Braintree's rich historical narrative. Beyond the aforementioned church and museum, the collection also includes the venerable town hall, the bustling market square, and a charming old railway station, all rendered with remarkable precision.

Producing these highly detailed pieces demanded considerable dedication and countless hours. Members painstakingly created unique textures and a precise palette of colours for every facade, window, and roof section. Following the knitting phase, these individual components were meticulously trimmed and firmly affixed to their respective bases, ensuring an accurate fit and a truly lifelike appearance. The exceptional accuracy of detail in these small-scale architectural recreations is truly commendable.

Renowned for her expertise in intricate textile crafts, Elaine Pye played a pivotal role in guiding the team through the project's complexities, imparting various techniques and fostering a collaborative and supportive atmosphere. Their collective commitment has culminated in a singular exhibition, beautifully showcasing Braintree's heritage and the Dolphin WI's impressive artistic talents.

The entire collection is slated for public exhibition at various community events and venues throughout Braintree over the coming months, beginning with its premiere at the Braintree Museum. This affords both local residents and visitors a wonderful opportunity to admire the elaborate craftsmanship and view their cherished town in a fresh, endearing light. The undertaking has successfully strengthened bonds among WI members and generated significant local enthusiasm, earning praise for its originality and charm.

The Dolphin Women's Institute hopes this unique display will serve as an inspiration to others, standing as a delightful testament to their ingenuity and dedication to enhancing local community life. Although primarily focused on Braintree, the project's success has also attracted interest from adjacent WI groups, with some members in Hertfordshire expressing a desire to embark on similar creative ventures.",1,1,True

Webb, who has been named on the bench, has not played for Wales since suffering a foot injury in September.
""We all knew that as soon as Webby was fit he was going to be straight back in the squad. I expected it,"" said Davies.
""It is a bit of extra pressure for me but I enjoy it.""
England are one point clear of Wales at the top of the table with three wins from three games.
Webb scored a try in the win over England in Cardiff in the 2015 Six Nations, while Davies scored a crucial late try in their victory in the 2015 World Cup, a competition Webb missed following surgery.
Davies, 25, has scored six tries in 12 Wales appearances while 27-year-old Webb has five in 16 games.
England have a 100% record under new coach Eddie Jones, while Wales beat Scotland and France after drawing their opening game in Ireland.
If England beat Wales they face a trip to France on 19 March chasing a first Grand Slam since 2003.
Victory for Wales on Saturday would leave them needing to beat Italy at home to win the championship for the third time in five years.
Davies said: ""In a couple of the games in this campaign we have started off a bit slowly.
""We have talked about the first 20 minutes. We have got to come out all guns blazing. That is going to be massive for us.
""We are quite confident and comfortable playing anywhere.

""The guys have accepted that something has to change, whether it's the way we approach it, or the way guys practice.""
A four-and-a-half-hour rain delay saw the game reduced to 22 overs a side, but Durham's score was their lowest against Worcestershire since becoming a first-class county in 1992.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,1183,"Hank Costain, 88, from Charminster, near Dorchester, first flew a Spitfire in 1942, at the age of 19.
The maiden flight of the Supermarine Spitfire took place on 5 March 1936, from Eastleigh Aerodrome, now Southampton Airport.
Mr Costain described flying a Spitfire as ""absolutely marvellous"".
He said: ""When you first got into the seat and opened the throttle it felt as if someone had given you a good kick up the bottom and away you went.
""It would do everything you asked of it. Compared to other aircraft it was light on the controls, you could do all the aerobatics and you would come up to speed very quickly.
""If you treated a Spitfire properly, it treated you properly. Treat it roughly or be careless with it and you were in trouble, in that it would do all sorts of things such as ground looping. It also had a very fragile undercarriage and could collapse.""
Mr Costain was a member of the RAF for 37 years.
He flew operational Spitfires over Europe, north Africa, the Middle East and Burma.
He was also a Spitfire instructor during that time and became a test pilot on Spitfires at 9MU Cosford, Shropshire.
He said: ""Everyone that joined the air force wanted to fly a Spitfire.
""I would say that I have flown nearly all of the operational Spitfires.
""There aren't many of us left [alive] that have flown the number of different marks of Spitfire that I have.""
During and since his flying days, Mr Costain says he has often been asked if he was frightened during the war years.
He said: ""I was terrified, but I was terrified of letting my own friends see that I was frightened. One made one's self very determined that you wouldn't show that.
""If you were attacked when you were flying a Spitfire during the war years, you turned hard into the attacking aircraft and they just couldn't get behind you! It was much more manoeuvrable than the German aircraft.

Nicky Barr, director of the centre, said it looked like those responsible had cut a perimeter fence and that the scuff marks inside the memorial were probably caused as the blocks fell.
""It is hugely disappointing that a memorial this county has worked so hard for, that honours the dead of Bomber Command, has been subjected to this kind of abject vandalism,"" she said.

""It's only been up about a year.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,1424,"Hank Costain, now 88 years old and residing in Charminster, a village near Dorchester, experienced his first flight in a Spitfire in 1942, when he was 19. This notable event took place several years after the Supermarine Spitfire's maiden flight on March 5, 1936, which originated from Eastleigh Aerodrome, now recognized as Southampton Airport. Mr. Costain frequently expresses immense fondness for piloting a Spitfire, famously calling the experience ""absolutely marvellous."" He vividly recounted the moment of takeoff: ""As I secured myself in the cockpit and advanced the throttle, I felt an abrupt, mighty surge, almost like a sharp propulsion from behind. The Merlin engine's thunderous roar was colossal, a magnificent, untamed symphony of strength that reverberated not only through the aircraft's structure but deep within my very bones. It transcended mere mechanics; it transformed into an extension of myself, a remarkably responsive, almost living entity that flawlessly executed every nuanced instruction.""

The Spitfire demonstrated extraordinary agility, with its controls feeling surprisingly light despite the aircraft's immense power. Once airborne, the landscape below dramatically shifted. Dorset's familiar fields and landmarks diminished into a finely detailed, miniature tableau, while the heavens above expanded into boundless infinity. In those moments, he experienced a profound sense of liberation, a complete unity with both the machine and the surrounding environment. They would execute demanding aerial stunts, pushing the plane to its operational boundaries. During rapid turns or steep climbs, the formidable G-forces pinned them firmly to their seats, generating an exceptional sense of thrill, a distinctive surge he considers unmatched by any other experience.

Mr. Costain reflected on his early training with a combination of nostalgia and a keen recognition of the grim aspects of wartime preparation. He explained that “Piloting the Supermarine Spitfire involved more than just control mastery; comprehending its individual character was equally crucial. Every aircraft possessed its own peculiarities, its specific temperament. One had to show it deference, and it would reciprocate by offering protection.” He remembered the unrelenting demands, the countless hours logged in the cockpit, and the rigorous practice routines designed to forge fledgling pilots into potent fighters. The aircraft's astonishing speed and agility, especially when contrasted with the less powerful training aircraft, was truly impressive. It marked a pivotal advancement, a marvel of engineering that positioned Britain as a leader in air combat.

For Mr. Costain, the Spitfire transcended being a mere airplane; it personified an entire epoch, a vehicle instrumental in reshaping historical events. “It guaranteed our very existence, didn't it?” he pondered, his gaze lost in the past. “It was universally acknowledged as the world's premier fighter plane. Every departure brought with it a weighty sense of duty, twinned with an overwhelming surge of pride.” He often visits airshows, his vision following the distinctive silhouette of a Spitfire as it executes elegant loops and descents, a moving reminder of his early life soaring across contemporary skies. The distinctive thrum of its engine continues to stir deep feelings, a powerful evocation of a time marked by bravery and innovation. Even after numerous decades, the memories of those flights persist with striking clarity, highlighting the deep influence the Supermarine Spitfire exerted on his personal journey and on innumerable others.",1,0,False

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,1870,"Kris Meeke, the Citroen driver hailing from Dungannon, swiftly took an early command in the Tour de Course, securing victory in three out of the initial four stages. While Sébastien Ogier remained a close contender, Meeke was clearly focused on capitalizing on his impressive Rally Mexico triumph with another dominant showing in Corsica. This event is well-known for its challenging asphalt surfaces and perilous turns. His powerful opening pace unmistakably broadcasted his intention to carry forward the momentum from Mexico, where a late surge had dramatically clinched him the win.

Known as the 'Rally of 10,000 Corners', the Tour de Course presented a stark contrast to Mexico's gravel roads and high altitudes. Instead, it demanded supreme precision and unyielding confidence on its fast tarmac. Meeke, behind the wheel of his Citroen C3 WRC, appeared perfectly adapted to these demanding conditions, pushing hard right from the first kilometer. His remarkable ability to push harder on Corsica's grueling routes left his rivals, particularly championship leader Ogier, with very little room for error.

Ogier, ever the shrewd strategist, opted for a cautious approach, conserving his tyres and carefully observing Meeke's impressive rhythm. He was keenly aware that any mistake on these tight, tree-lined roads could have disastrous repercussions. This escalating contest between the two motorsport giants promised to be a classic. Meeke was not only pursuing victory but also seeking to validate his form after an inconsistent start to the season. His win in Mexico had silenced some detractors, but a strong performance here in the Tour de Course would solidify his standing as a serious title contender. All eyes now turn to the upcoming stages, where both mental and physical pressures are certain to intensify, severely testing the resolve of the Northern Irish driver and his persistent French rival.",1,0,False

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task5_sampling_70_30,1955,"In Castlemilk, Glasgow, a father and his son endured a brutal assault last Friday evening, around 8:05 PM. Police reports confirm the young boy was viciously attacked while walking along Ardencraig Quadrant, close to its intersection with Ardencraig Drive. His 52-year-old father, witnessing the violence unfold, was also set upon as he attempted to shield his son. Both individuals were subsequently hospitalized to treat injuries to their faces.

Police have initiated a thorough investigation into this alarming incident and are appealing for public assistance. Detective Inspector Peter McFarlane, who is leading the inquiry, described the assault as ""senseless and brutal."" He elaborated that this unprovoked act of aggression targeted a young boy and his father, whose sole intention was to defend him. This terrifying ordeal has left both victims deeply traumatized, and law enforcement is determined to identify and apprehend those responsible. While their facial wounds were not critical, they necessitated medical attention and caused considerable distress.

DI McFarlane urged anyone who was in the vicinity of Ardencraig Quadrant or Ardencraig Drive in Castlemilk, Glasgow, at the time of the attack to contact the police. He particularly sought information from individuals who may have noticed suspicious persons in the area or possess dashcam or private CCTV recordings that could aid the investigation. Emphasizing the potential importance of even seemingly minor details in reconstructing the events and pinpointing the assailants, he also addressed the concerns of local residents. He provided reassurance that comprehensive inquiries are being conducted and that officers will maintain a visible presence on patrol to alleviate community fears.

Anyone with pertinent information is asked to contact Police Scotland by dialling 101, quoting incident number [XXXX] from the day it occurred. Alternatively, anonymous submissions can be made to Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111.

Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Melanie Croy told the jury Mr Capp's ability to form rational judgement was impaired because of his mental illness.
Mr Capp admits killing Mr Thomas but denies murder.
Appearing for the defence, Dr Croy, who works at Ashworth high security hospital where Mr Capp has been detained, said he suffered from an abnormality of mental function, which could diminish his responsibility for Mr Thomas's murder.
Dr Croy told the court Mr Capp suffered from paranoid delusional beliefs and heard two voices in his head.
One, which he describes as Mr Grey, tells him to harm others and himself, the jury was told.
Since he has been at Ashworth hospital, Mr Capp has described voices telling him to kill others with his bare hands, she said.
A second female voice acts as a guardian and gives him advice, the court was told.
Mr Capp told Dr Croy he believed he was being tortured at Cardiff prison in the weeks leading to the killing and thought he was going to be killed.
A different consultant psychiatrist, on behalf of the prosecution, believes Mr Capp has a personality disorder rather than a mental illness.
Dr Phillip Joseph told the jury he believed Mr Capp understood what he was doing when he killed his cellmate.
MrThomas was discovered dead in the cell with a plastic bag wrapped around his head. He had been stabbed 100 times in the neck with a ball point pen.
Mr Capp denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

The origin of its unrusted iron blade has baffled scientists because such metalwork was rare in ancient Egypt.
Tutankhamun was mummified more than 3,300 years ago.
Italian and Egyptian researchers used ""a non-invasive X-ray technique"" to confirm the composition of the iron without damaging it, according to a study published in the journal of Meteoritics and Planetary Science.
Tutankhamun's beard glued back on
'High chance' of chamber in Tut's tomb
""Meteoritic iron is clearly indicated by the presence of a high percentage of nickel,"" the study's main author, Daniela Comelli, said.
The researchers say the presence of iron - along with levels of nickel and cobalt - ""strongly suggests an extraterrestrial origin"".
They compared the composition of the dagger to known meteorites within 2,000km around the Red Sea coast of Egypt, and found that one in particular - which landed 150 miles (240km) west of Alexandria - contained similar levels of nickel and cobalt.
Ancient Egyptians attached great significance to meteoritic iron for the production of fine ornamental or ceremonial objects, the researchers say.
""They were aware that these rare chunks of iron fell from the sky already in the 13th [Century] BCE, anticipating Western culture by more than two millennia,"" they write in their findings.
The high manufacturing quality of the blade in comparison with other simple-shaped meteoritic iron artefacts ""suggests a significant mastery of ironworking in Tutankhamun's time"", they say.
The dagger - which features a decorated gold handle and a gold sheath with a floral lily motif on one side and a feather pattern on the other - is now on display at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
