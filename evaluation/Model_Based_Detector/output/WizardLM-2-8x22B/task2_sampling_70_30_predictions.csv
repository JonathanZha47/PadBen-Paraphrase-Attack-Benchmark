This ambitious Dolphin Women's Institute project aimed to capture Braintree's unique character through miniature landmarks. Initiated during lockdowns, it offered members a creative outlet and shared goal. Led by talented Elaine Pye, a long-standing member and avid knitter, the group focused on iconic structures defining Braintree's heritage. Beyond the meticulously crafted church and museum, other notable additions include the historic town hall, vibrant market square, and a miniature old railway station, each brought to life with incredible detail. The intricate process involved members dedicating countless hours to knitting specific textures and colours for each building's facade, windows, and roofs. Completed knitted sections were then carefully cut and sewn onto prepared cores, ensuring a perfect fit and realistic appearance. The precision for these miniature architectural marvels is truly impressive. Elaine Pye, known for her intricate textile art, guided the team through challenging aspects, sharing techniques and encouraging collaborative work. This dedication has resulted in a unique exhibition celebrating both the town's history and the incredible crafting skills within the Dolphin Women's Institute. The completed collection is set to be displayed at various community events and local venues across Braintree throughout the coming months, starting with an inaugural viewing at the Braintree Museum. This public display will allow residents and visitors alike to appreciate the intricate workmanship and recognise their beloved town in a brand new, whimsical format. The project has fostered community among WI members and generated considerable local interest, drawing praise for its originality and charm. The Dolphin Women's Institute hopes this unique collection will inspire others, serving as a delightful testament to their creativity and commitment to enriching local life. While primarily focused on Braintree, the project's success has even garnered attention from neighbouring WI groups, with some Hertfordshire members expressing interest in similar initiatives.",1,0,False

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,627,"That is according to new figures from Northern Ireland Screen, which has provided production funding for the HBO series.
The programme, some of which is filmed in Northern Ireland, has been nominated for 24 Emmy awards.
Two of those nominations are for Northern Ireland production crew members.
Ronan Hill, who won an Emmy in 2012, has been nominated again for outstanding sound mixing for a drama, while Carla Stronge has been nominated for outstanding casting for a drama.
Northern Ireland Screen has invested ¬£12.45m in the series since it began in 2010.
For that investment, it is estimated that ¬£110.7m has been spent on goods and services in the Northern Ireland economy.
From 2010-14, Game of Thrones brought in between ¬£21m and ¬£23m a year to Northern Ireland. Those figures have been audited.
In 2014-15, in which series five of Game of Thrones was filmed, NI Screen invested ¬£1.6m in the programme, and the return that created is estimated at ¬£22m.
Game of Thrones is filmed at the Titanic Studios in Belfast, and many other locations across Northern Ireland.
Many local companies are involved in providing services when the series is in production, and sites from the show have become tourist attractions.
Damian Carr, from Game of Thrones Tours, said fans come from all over the world to visit the filming locations.
""We've had people from North and South America, all over Asia - China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan - and all across Europe.
""We started off running one tour a week; now we're running five.""
Richard Williams, chief executive of NI Screen, said Game of Thrones had established Northern Ireland as a world-class location for film and TV production.
""Additionally, films and television programmes have a significant, positive effect on tourism; they contribute to a wider 'branding' of people, society and culture, all of which has a very strong influence on creating a desire to travel.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,683,"It is understood the Hammers will raise their offer for the player who began his career at the east London club.
Defoe, 34, has scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for the Premier League strugglers this season.
His latest goals came on Monday as Sunderland twice fought from a goal down to draw 2-2 with in-form Liverpool, which left manager David Moyes's side in 18th position.
Defoe's senior career began at West Ham before he moved to rivals Tottenham in a ¬£7m deal in 2004, with striker Bobby Zamora going the other way. A ¬£7.5m move to Portsmouth followed in January 2008 before he returned to Spurs the following year for ¬£15m.
Defoe made a surprise move to Canadian team Toronto FC in 2014 before he was  lured to Sunderland in 2015 by former Black Cats boss and ex-Spurs team-mate Gus Poyet.
BBC Radio 5 live's chief football correspondent Ian Dennis
West Ham will return to test the resolve of Sunderland, but it's unthinkable the Black Cats can afford to sell Defoe given their precarious position.
David Moyes recently described Defoe as ""priceless"" and his goals will be the difference as to whether they can preserve their top-flight status.
Premium and proven goalscorers are in short supply which is why West Ham themselves are looking at the 34-year-old.

The government chief whip was seen with a massive grin after tonight's vote.
Remember ministers' climbdown came with a clever kicker, persuading Labour to sign up to their timetable for triggering Article 50 without committing to very much in return - the vague promise of a plan that could be as detailed as the back of the proverbial fag packet.
There's grumpiness on the Labour benches at how it was handled - angry conversations taking place, sources suggest - a sense among some that the front bench allowed themselves to be hoodwinked by the government's cunning plan.
Potential Tory rebels on the Remain side are deeply suspicious of the government's real intentions for giving more information about its ideas for Brexit. They backed off today, but will be back for more, no question.
But beyond the immediate machinations and the chief whip's big grin, two realities are confirmed by the events of the last 24 hours.
Yes - the numbers tonight suggest not very many MPs will actually try to block Brexit, or frustrate the process. They will certainly try to push the government for more details. They will certainly try to amend the proposals that eventually make it to the Commons, whenever that is. That could disrupt and delay things, but trying to stop it happening is not on the agenda of the vast majority.
But what's equally clear is that Theresa May does not have a secure majority on the EU. As soon as her plans (eventually) hit the floor of the House, she's likely to have to compromise.
That is precisely why the government is fighting so hard just across the road in the Supreme Court to try to avoid MPs having a say before the really hard work in Brussels even begins.",0,0,True

His family welcomed the comments and said they hoped the Lord Advocate would establish "" the truth of what happened "" . Mr Mullholland told MSPs that further work was needed by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner before a fatal accident inquiry could be held into Mr Bayoh's death. He explained that PIRC needed to finalise several lines of inquiry and consolidate all evidence pertaining to the incident in Kirkcaldy on 3 May. This comprehensive approach was vital to ensure the inquiry would be as thorough as possible, leaving no aspect of Mr Bayoh's passing unexamined. The Lord Advocate, Frank Mulholland, stressed his commitment to a robust and transparent process, assuring MSPs that justice would be diligently pursued for the family.

The family's lawyer, Aamer Anwar, while acknowledging the need for a thorough investigation, reiterated their urgent desire for the inquiry to be convened without undue delay. He conveyed the immense emotional strain the prolonged wait was placing on Mr Bayoh's relatives, who have campaigned relentlessly for answers. Mr Anwar emphasised that establishing ""the truth of what happened"" to Mr Bayoh in police custody remained their paramount goal, seeing the FAI as the essential mechanism for achieving this.

Mr Mullholland’s statement highlighted the complexity of the case. The fatal accident inquiry, once initiated, will meticulously examine all circumstances surrounding Mr Bayoh’s death, including the conduct of officers involved, medical care provided, and any systemic issues. The Lord Advocate confirmed his statutory duty to investigate deaths in custody with independence and integrity. The Sheku Bayoh case has generated significant public concern regarding police accountability in Scotland. Mr Mullholland assured MSPs that the FAI would commence promptly once PIRC’s work was completed to his satisfaction, providing a public forum for facts to be established regarding Mr Bayoh's death in Kirkcaldy.",1,0,False

It recommends a single group taking forward all issues that tackle town centre improvements.

He said the authority was taking positive steps with shops' vacancy rates reducing due to more independent shops opening, but he admitted bigger units formerly occupied by multi national firms were ""harder to fill"".

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,984,"Hina Rabbani Khar's remarks came hours after the two armies agreed to ""de-escalate"" tensions after a meeting of their chiefs of operations.
Tensions have risen following deadly exchanges along the border last week.
The violence has plunged the neighbours into the worst crisis in relations since the Mumbai attacks of 2008, blamed on militants based in Pakistan.
""Instead of issuing belligerent statements by the military and political leaders from across the border and ratcheting up tension, it is advisable for the two countries to discuss all concerns related to Line of Control (LoC) with a view to reinforcing respect for the ceasefire,"" Ms Khar's office said.
AFP news agency quotes her as saying that the recent border clashes had ""created questions"" and added that Pakistan was ""open"" to dialogue between foreign ministers to end the dispute.
India has not commented on Ms Khar's remarks so far.
On Wednesday the Pakistani army's director of military operations agreed to the de-escalation after calling his Indian counterpart to ""protest strongly"" a ""ceasefire violation"" by Indian soldiers that killed a Pakistani soldier along the LoC on Tuesday night.
India has denied the allegation, which comes after separate incidents last week, in which two Indian soldiers and two Pakistani soldiers died.
The Pakistani commander said strict orders had been passed to troops on the LoC to observe a ceasefire that has been in place since 2003, a spokesman for the Indian army, Col Jagdeep Dahiya, told the BBC.
Both sides deny provoking the clashes, amid fears that a fledgling peace process under way since last February could unravel, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi.
On Tuesday, Indian PM Manmohan Singh said the killing of the Indian soldiers last week - one of whom India says was beheaded - was ""unacceptable"".

The deaths deepened political tensions in Paraguay and were used by congress to oust the left-wing President Fernando Lugo.
Four men received sentences of between 18 and 30 years in jail, while a further seven men and women were given sentences of between four and six years.
The court heard how the clashes occurred near the city of Curuguaty in Canindeyu province in the east of Paraguay when a group of around 250 riot police were sent to clear a group of around 70 subsistence farmers off a property belonging to an agricultural company called Campos Morumbi.
The farmers had occupied the land as part of a demonstration in favour of agrarian reform.
The Paraguayan prosecution service did not investigate the deaths of the farmers who died during the eviction.
Local and international human rights organizations alleged there had been judicial irregularities during the trial.
Five of the accused had gone on hunger strike for more than 30 days.

According to the 2008 census, 2.6% of landowners hold 85.5% of Paraguay's land while 91.4% of small farmers, with properties smaller than 20 hectare, hold only 6% of the agricultural land.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,1628,"As many as 23 civilians were killed in the raid on a village in Yakla district on Saturday, including 10 children, rights group Reprieve says.
Yemeni reports say the victims included the daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, a militant killed by a US strike in 2011.
The raid was the first such operation authorised by President Donald Trump.
The US military had previously said a Navy Seal, William ""Ryan"" Owens, 36, died and three others were injured. But the US Central Command (Centcom) later said that those killed could include children.
Several Apache helicopters were reported to have taken part in the operation, which killed 14 militants, including three al-Qaeda leaders, according to the US military.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer told journalists: ""It's hard to ever call something a complete success when you have a loss of life or people injured.""
""But I think when you look at the totality of what was gained to prevent the future loss of life... I think it's a successful operation in all standards.""
He made no mention of civilian victims.
Earlier on Thursday, Reprieve said a newborn baby was among 10 children killed in the attack.
It also cited local reports as saying that a heavily pregnant woman was shot in the stomach during the raid and subsequently gave birth to an injured baby boy who later died.
Images of several dead children emerged on social media soon after the attack took place.
Earlier this week, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis told reporters to ""take reports of female casualties with a grain of salt"", adding that they had been ""trained to be ready and trained to be combatants"".
But US military Central Command on Wednesday acknowledged that a number of civilians had been ""likely killed in the midst of a firefight"".
Mr Trump travelled to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on Thursday to receive the body of the US Navy Seal, William 'Ryan' Owens, who was killed in the raid.
Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the civil war in Yemen to entrench its presence in the south and south-east of the country.

However , he sustained a calf injury as the Italians fought back to win 2 - 1 . "" We will have to see how Vincent is on Wednesday , "" said City manager Manuel Pellegrini . "" We will check and see how serious the injury is . "" Kompany , 29 , was replaced by Nicolas Otamendi - City 's £32 million summer signing from Valencia. The Belgium international had been in outstanding form at the start of the season, scoring two goals in four Premier League games and leading a defence that had not conceded a single goal prior to Tuesday’s Champions League opener. His forced withdrawal against Juventus is a significant blow for Manuel Pellegrini’s side, especially given Kompany’s history of calf problems. The City captain has been plagued by similar injuries throughout his career, leading to concerns about his long-term availability.

Pellegrini expressed his immediate worry in the post-match media briefing, acknowledging the severity of losing such a pivotal player. ""It's a very important injury for Vincent,"" he reiterated. ""He was playing very well and we hope it's not a serious one. We will know more after he has a scan."" The manager also confirmed that Sergio Aguero, who had been substituted in the first half of Saturday's Premier League win over Crystal Palace, was not fit enough to feature against the Italians. The absence of both Kompany and Aguero highlights the squad depth challenges that City might face as they navigate a demanding schedule of domestic and European fixtures. The team’s strong start to the Premier League season has built high expectations, and maintaining that momentum will require all players to stay fit and perform.

The defensive partnership between Kompany and Otamendi was one that City fans were eager to see develop, with the Argentine having been eased into the squad. Now, Otamendi is likely to be thrust into a starting role much sooner than anticipated, potentially alongside Eliaquim Mangala or Martin Demichelis. The loss to Juventus, despite Kompany's early influence in pressuring Giorgio Chiellini for the own goal, marked a disappointing start to City’s Champions League campaign. The focus will now shift to how Pellegrini reshapes his defence and inspires a response from his team in the upcoming derby against Manchester United. The media will undoubtedly scrutinize City’s defensive performance in the absence of their influential captain, Vincent Kompany, as they aim to bounce back from this early European setback and continue their impressive domestic form.",1,1,True

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,1685,"Andreea Cristea is the fifth victim of the attack on 22 March, in which Khalid Masood drove into crowds on Westminster Bridge then stabbed a policeman to death, before being shot dead himself.
Ms Cristea, 31, who was on holiday with boyfriend Andrei Burnaz, had been in hospital since the attack.
It has emerged that Mr Burnaz had been planning to propose during the day out.
A family statement confirmed Ms Cristea, who was an architect, had died on Thursday.
The family said: ""After fighting for her life for over two weeks, our beloved and irreplaceable Andreea - wonderful daughter, sister, partner, dedicated friend and the most unique and life loving person you can imagine - was cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way.
""She will always be remembered as our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts.""
The family said they were ""deeply touched and eternally grateful"" to the ""never-ending dedication"" of the medical staff who treated Ms Cristea, saying their ""kindness and empathy are beyond compare"".
""There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and emptiness that is left in our hearts,"" they continued.
Mr Burnaz, who sustained a broken foot in the attack, visited Westminster Bridge last week to lay a single white rose.
The couple were in London to celebrate Mr Burnaz's birthday and he had been planning to propose to Ms Cristea that day, Romania's UK ambassador Dan Mihalache told the BBC.
He said it was thought Masood's car had mounted the pavement and hit Mr Burnaz, before pushing Ms Cristea into the Thames.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was ""deeply saddened to hear of the death of Andreea Cristea"".
He tweeted: ""Londoners hold her & her loved ones in our thoughts today.""
The other people killed on the bridge were Aysha Frade, 44, who worked at a London sixth-form college, US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah, and retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, from south London.
Father-of-two PC Keith Palmer was fatally stabbed outside Parliament.
Relatives of those killed joined members of the Royal Family at a ""service of hope"" held at Westminster Abbey on Wednesday.

Sheeran's comeback follows a ""gap year"" where he removed himself from social media, making space to write his third album, √É¬∑ (Divide).
Fans were clearly hungry for new material, as the star set several streaming records over the course of the week.
Shape Of You's bouncy, uptempo pop was the bigger hit, notching up 13.4 million streams - smashing the record Drake set last summer, when One Dance was streamed 8.9 million in a single week.
Castle On The Hill, built around a chiming, U2-style guitar riff, also beat Drake's tally, with 11.07 million streams.
On Spotify, Sheeran also broke a global streaming record held by One Direction, whose single Drag Me Down racked up 4.76m streams in one day in August 2015.
Shape Of You was streamed 6.13 million times when it was released last Friday, increasing to 7.24 million streams on Monday.

The long-lost station only served passengers from 1902 to 1915 before shutting for good.
The ¬£6.5bn Thameslink Programme is rebuilding railway lines from New Cross Gate through London Bridge to Blackfriars and St Pancras.
Located on a viaduct above Rotherhithe New Road, Southwark Park was one of several stations in the area, including Spa Road, which closed because of competition from trams and buses and the outbreak of World War One.
The station was discovered as engineers constructed the Bermondsey Dive Under, which will see two Victorian viaducts partially-demolished and rebuilt to allow trains from south east London and Kent to dive down, under a new route carrying Thameslink services from Croydon.
Project manager Greg Thornett said: ""We uncovered the footings for the former platforms while we were preparing the top of the viaduct for new track and we are now working up in the roof space of the former ticket hall to fill in the old skylights, ready to carry the final track alignment.

Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Melanie Croy told the jury Mr Capp's ability to form rational judgement was impaired because of his mental illness.
Mr Capp admits killing Mr Thomas but denies murder.
Appearing for the defence, Dr Croy, who works at Ashworth high security hospital where Mr Capp has been detained, said he suffered from an abnormality of mental function, which could diminish his responsibility for Mr Thomas's murder.
Dr Croy told the court Mr Capp suffered from paranoid delusional beliefs and heard two voices in his head.
One, which he describes as Mr Grey, tells him to harm others and himself, the jury was told.
Since he has been at Ashworth hospital, Mr Capp has described voices telling him to kill others with his bare hands, she said.
A second female voice acts as a guardian and gives him advice, the court was told.
Mr Capp told Dr Croy he believed he was being tortured at Cardiff prison in the weeks leading to the killing and thought he was going to be killed.
A different consultant psychiatrist, on behalf of the prosecution, believes Mr Capp has a personality disorder rather than a mental illness.
Dr Phillip Joseph told the jury he believed Mr Capp understood what he was doing when he killed his cellmate.
MrThomas was discovered dead in the cell with a plastic bag wrapped around his head. He had been stabbed 100 times in the neck with a ball point pen.
Mr Capp denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,2636,"The statement from the firm came just days after it announced the sale of the Financial Times to Japan 's Nikkei . Pearson said it was in discussions regarding the sale of the Economist but there was "" no certainty that this process will lead to a transaction "". This divestment of its print media holdings, including the iconic Financial Times, signals a clear strategic pivot for Pearson. The company, under CEO John Fallon, is increasingly focusing on its global education business, aiming to streamline its portfolio and concentrate resources on digital learning and assessment tools. This marks the end of an era for Pearson as a diversified media conglomerate, aligning with a broader industry trend of specialization.

The potential sale of its 50% stake in the Economist Group, which publishes the influential weekly magazine, presents a more intricate challenge. Unlike the straightforward acquisition of the Financial Times by Japan's Nikkei, the Economist has a unique ownership structure designed to safeguard its editorial independence. A trust holds a significant portion of shares, and a consortium of long-standing family shareholders – including the Rothschilds, Cadburys, and Schroders, alongside Italy's powerful Agnelli family through their investment vehicle Exor – own the remaining stakes. John Elkann, chairman of Exor, had publicly expressed interest in increasing their shareholding, emphasizing their commitment to maintaining the publication's journalistic integrity and distinct ethos.

This inherent complexity, requiring consensus among existing shareholders deeply invested in the Economist's long-term vision, explains Pearson's cautious statement regarding ""no certainty."" For Pearson, completing these divestitures would solidify its identity as a pure-play education company, allowing it to dedicate all efforts to developing digital learning platforms globally and capitalize on the evolving education sector.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,2682,"RamJam uploaded Southern Rail Tycoon on Thursday, and so far 45,000 people have played the tongue-in-cheek game.
The aim is to stop guards from boarding trains, which leads to services being cancelled as profits are collected from passengers.
It was inspired by months of cancellations due to an RMT dispute.
Once a sufficient number of train guards board on a train and a delayed service eventually departs, the player loses the game.
Brighton-based developer Tom Jackson said: ""We all were planning to go to London a month ago and trains were delayed, then delayed, then delayed and then eventually cancelled.
""We were so frustrated by the whole thing that we've stopped using the trains.""
Mr Jackson, along with his colleagues Phil Hart and Toby Funnell, developed the game as a result of that experience.
The 39-year-old said that the purpose of the game was a mixture of providing commuters with something fun to do while waiting for delayed trains and also making people aware of the compensation policy.
When the game is over, links appear to the Southern Rail compensation page and twitter account.
He added: ""We like to do pieces that are reactive and demonstrate the impact [news events] have on people.
""It's incredibly frustrating, the train service is an absolute shambles.""
A Southern Rail spokesman said: ""Southern makes no money by cancelling trains - in fact the opposite is true.
""We are trying hard to give passengers the best service possible under very difficult circumstances and apologise sincerely.""
The RMT union and GTR are in a dispute regarding the proposed introduction of more driver-only operated (DOO) services, which would change conductors' roles.
As a result of regular walkouts, Southern cancelled 341 daily train services on 11 July to improve ""reliability"". Since then 15 have been reinstated.

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,2788,"RamJam uploaded Southern Rail Tycoon on Thursday , and so far 45,000 people have played the tongue - in - cheek game . The aim is to stop guards from boarding trains , which leads to services being cancelled as profits are collected from passengers . It was inspired by months of cancellations due to an RMT dispute . Once a sufficient number of train guards board on a train and a delayed service eventually departs , the player loses the round, and is presented with a screen showing plummeting profits and irate pixelated commuters storming a virtual London Victoria station. The game, created by Brighton-based indie developer Tom Jackson, under his studio moniker RamJam, has rapidly become a viral sensation. Jackson, a long-time frustrated commuter on the Southern Rail network himself, explained the inspiration behind the satirical hit: 'I spent so many hours delayed on platforms, watching those departure boards mock me, that I just had to channel that frustration into something. It started as a joke among friends, but the more I worked on 'Southern Rail Tycoon', the more I realised how many people could relate to the sheer absurdity of it all.'

The game’s dark humour resonates deeply with those who have endured the real-life chaos on the network. Players must strategically deploy various humorous obstacles, from ‘broken signal’ alerts to ‘leaf on the line’ incidents, all designed to prevent guards from reaching their designated carriages. The more services cancelled, the higher the player's 'tycoon' score, reflecting their fictional mastery over the beleaguered railway. If too many services depart on time, or if guards successfully board multiple trains, the player's 'profit margin' collapses, leading to a swift game over.

Despite its cynical premise, Tom Jackson insists the game is not meant to be a serious political statement, but rather a cathartic outlet. 'It’s about making light of a difficult situation,' he stated. 'It’s satire. It’s a way for people to laugh at the chaos, rather than just fuming about it. We’ve had messages from people in London, Brighton, and all along the line saying how much they appreciate being able to turn their anger into amusement, even if it’s just for a few minutes.' RamJam is now considering updates to Southern Rail Tycoon, including new scenarios and 'disaster' events, as well as a potential mobile version, cementing its status as a cult classic for exasperated commuters everywhere.",1,1,True

WizardLM-2-8x22B,task2_sampling_70_30,2839,"The study tracked more than 200,000 Australian smokers and non - smokers above the age of 45 over six years . Mortality risk went up with cigarette use , BMC Medicine reports . Smoking 10 cigarettes a day doubled the risk , while 20 - a - day smokers were four to five times more likely to die . Although someone who smokes could lead a long life , their habit makes this less likely . Smoking increases the risk of a multitude of health problems, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and respiratory illnesses. The study, published in BMC Medicine, underscored the profound impact of even moderate smoking on mortality rates, reinforcing decades of research on the dangers of tobacco. Lung cancer is perhaps the most well-known consequence, but smoking also significantly elevates the risk of cancers of the throat, mouth, oesophagus, bladder, kidney, pancreas, stomach, and cervix, as well as acute myeloid leukaemia. Beyond cancer, smokers are at a much higher risk of heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, and bronchitis. It also contributes to conditions like type 2 diabetes, age-related macular degeneration (leading to blindness), and osteoporosis, weakening bones.

Prof Emily Banks, a leading researcher involved in the BMC Medicine study, emphasised that ""Even smoking a few cigarettes a day has substantial effects on mortality."" Her work, along with findings from other major health organisations, consistently points to a clear dose-response relationship between cigarette use and adverse health outcomes. Organizations such as Cancer Research UK and the American Cancer Society have long championed public health campaigns to reduce smoking rates, highlighting the preventable nature of many tobacco-related diseases. In the UK, significant progress has been made in reducing smoking prevalence, but it remains a leading cause of premature death and illness. The message from health experts is clear: quitting smoking at any age can dramatically improve health prospects and extend life, reducing the heightened risks associated with continued tobacco use. Even for long-term smokers, quitting starts a process of healing and risk reduction that can add years to one's life and improve overall quality of health. The evidence is overwhelming: every cigarette takes a toll on the body, making the decision to quit one of the most beneficial steps an individual can take for their health and well-being.",1,1,True
