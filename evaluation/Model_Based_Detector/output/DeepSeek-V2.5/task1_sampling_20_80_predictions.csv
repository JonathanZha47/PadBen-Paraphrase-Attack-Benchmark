Head coach Rob Baxter stated, ""While we're still awaiting the full diagnosis, the injury appears to be quite serious."" Before joining the Chiefs, Salvi was twice nominated for the Premiership's Player of the Year award during his time at Leicester and previously captained Australia's Under-21 team. ""His immense 80-minute contribution is what we'll likely miss most,"" Baxter conveyed to BBC Sport. Baxter further explained, ""His greatest attribute is his reliability. He performs consistently every week; even when the team or individual players have struggled, Julian's performance has consistently been outstanding. He is almost always our leading tackler and breakdown clearer, and what many people underestimate is his significance to our offensive play.

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,177,"RamJam recently launched 'Southern Rail Tycoon' on Thursday, attracting 45,000 players to its satirical gameplay. In this light-hearted game, the objective is to prevent guards from boarding trains. Succeeding in this leads to service cancellations, from which players 'profit' by collecting virtual fares. The game draws its inspiration from the persistent train cancellations experienced over recent months, a result of an ongoing dispute with the RMT union. Players lose when a sufficient number of guards successfully board a train, causing the delayed service to finally depart.

Tom Jackson, a developer based in Brighton, shared his personal frustration, recounting how a planned trip to London a month prior was repeatedly delayed and then ultimately cancelled, leading his group to abandon train travel altogether. This frustrating experience prompted Mr. Jackson and his colleagues, Phil Hart and Toby Funnell, to create the game. The 39-year-old developer explained that the game serves a dual purpose: offering a fun distraction for commuters enduring train delays and raising awareness about the available compensation policies. Upon game completion, links are provided to Southern Rail's official compensation page and their Twitter account.

Jackson further elaborated that their studio enjoys creating games that are ""reactive"" to current events, demonstrating the ""impact"" news has on individuals. He described the train service as ""an absolute shambles"" and ""incredibly frustrating"".

A spokesperson for Southern Rail countered, stating that cancelling trains actually results in financial losses for them. They expressed efforts to provide the ""best service possible under very difficult circumstances"" and offered a ""sincere apology"".

The root of the ongoing issue lies in a dispute between the RMT union and GTR concerning the proposed increase in driver-only operated (DOO) services, which would alter the responsibilities of conductors. Due to regular strikes, Southern cancelled 341 daily train services on July 11, citing a need to improve ""reliability."" Since then, 15 of these services have been reinstated.

The continuous delays on the line, managed by Govia Thameslink Railway, led to the resignation of Rail Minister Claire Perry last Friday. The new Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling, declared on Monday that resolving the strike action was ""top of his priority list"".",1,0,False

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,562,"Dave Cormack, who previously served as Aberdeen's chief executive, recently sold his software company for £630 million. He informed the Aberdeen website that he would contribute both financially and with his time, aiming to draw in US investment and form strategic alliances to help the club reach its full potential. Cormack will collaborate with the current board, including chairman Stewart Milne, dividing his time between Atlanta and North East Scotland. The 58-year-old previously held an interim chief executive role at Pittodrie from 2000 to 2001, while on a break from his business ventures in the United States. He intends to work alongside the AFC management team to implement innovative strategies he's observed succeeding in the US. His return follows the sale of a software company he significantly expanded, growing its team from 12 employees in 2004 to 500 by 2016, and generating £107 million in yearly revenue. Cormack stated his honor at rejoining the board, noting he had consistently supported and advised the club for years. He commended the dedication of everyone at Pittodrie, evidenced by the club's strong performance both athletically and administratively in recent seasons. He acknowledged the fortunate position of having a high-performing, debt-free team, but stressed the necessity of capitalizing on opportunities to boost income and expand the fanbase. He expressed eagerness to collaborate with the current leadership team, with whom he shares a strong rapport. Cormack is confident that, working together and with fan support, they can enhance the club's financial standing, enlarge its supporter base, and develop a modern community stadium and training complex, enabling AFC to effectively leverage developments in European club competitions.

Gareth Davies affirmed that Webb's immediate return was anticipated once he regained fitness, noting that the added competition creates ""a bit of extra pressure"" which he finds enjoyable.

Currently, England leads Wales by one point at the top of the table, having secured three victories from three games. Both players have a history of impactful performances against England: Webb famously scored a try in Wales' 2015 Six Nations win in Cardiff, while Davies delivered a crucial late try in their 2015 World Cup victory, a tournament Webb missed following surgery. Davies, 25, has accumulated six tries in 12 Wales appearances, in contrast to 27-year-old Webb's five tries in 16 games.

Under new coach Eddie Jones, England boasts an unblemished record. Wales, meanwhile, rebounded from an opening draw in Ireland to defeat Scotland and France. If England overcomes Wales, they will travel to France on March 19th, aiming for their first Grand Slam since 2003. Conversely, a Welsh triumph on Saturday would position them to win the championship for the third time in five years by simply defeating Italy at home.

Davies admitted that Wales has started some games in this campaign slowly. He stressed the importance of the initial 20 minutes, stating, ""We have got to come out all guns blazing. That is going to be massive for us."" He also conveyed confidence in playing on any ground, referencing their strong performances at Twickenham during the World Cup as evidence that it is ""not a place we are scared to go.""",1,0,False

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,822,"During his Open Championship debut at Royal Birkdale, 38-year-old Manley briefly held the lead, achieving a two-under-par score despite the challenging weather. A pleased Manley conveyed to BBC Radio Wales that he had initially considered par to be a respectable outcome for his first attempt. He concluded his round impressively, scoring an eagle three on the par-five 17th and a birdie on the final hole. Manley remarked that ending the round a couple of strokes under par felt 'great'. This strong finish marked a significant recovery from a nervous beginning, where he lost a stroke on the first hole after his opening drive at one of golf's major tournaments landed in the rough. He described feeling extremely anxious on the first tee, admitting he was 'shaking a little bit' due to the 'horrific' weather. He also mentioned difficulties warming up and a lack of rhythm while wearing his waterproof gear. Manley confessed it was likely the 'most nervous' he had ever been for a tee shot, but expressed optimism about understanding what to anticipate for the next day, hinting at a 'better game plan'. Manley, a professional golfer since 2003 and the sole Welsh competitor at Royal Birkdale, enjoyed considerable support from spectators. He noted the presence of friends from his local golf club, Mountain Ash, and his family, making his good score particularly satisfying for them. He admitted the achievement hadn't fully 'sunk in' yet, suggesting it might become real once he watched some golf later that evening, but confirmed he felt 'pretty chuffed'. Ranked 520th globally, Manley is scheduled to begin his second round on Friday at 11:47 BST. Despite his strong start, he is not adjusting his objectives for the week. He emphasized the need to 'plot your way around the course' due to the demanding links, stating he wouldn't allow his mind to 'wander'.",1,0,False

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,970,"This initiative stems from an increasing trend among oil and gas companies to deploy unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for offshore inspections and various other operations. These guidelines were collaboratively created by specialists in industry, aviation safety, and UAS operation. They outline optimal practices, operational procedures, and the necessary certifications to ensure adherence to UAS regulations.

Mick Borwell, Oil and Gas UK's health, safety, and environment director, observed that while the number is currently small, more oil and gas operators are increasingly utilizing UAS primarily for inspections, but also for aerial photography, surveying, and security purposes. This technology is especially appealing due to its capacity to enhance safety. For instance, deploying unmanned aircraft for inspections in confined spaces instead of human personnel significantly mitigates risks, proving both effective and efficient. We anticipate their deployment will expand.

Mr. Borwell stated that these new guidelines are intended to align with the existing safety and operational benchmarks already in place on the UK Continental Shelf for offshore oil and gas extraction and helicopter flight activities. He further explained that the objective is to prompt offshore operators considering this nascent technology to contemplate the complete offshore operating and safety framework, rather than focusing solely on the aerial vehicle itself.",1,1,True

Jones indicated this could sideline him for several months, a considerable blow given his excellent current form and his rising challenge for a spot in the national team, vying with Dan Biggar. Additionally, scrum-half Sarel Pretorius also departed the Liberty Stadium pitch due to a recurring calf problem.

However, the Dragons anticipate the return of Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan later this month. These Wales internationals have been out of action since suffering shoulder injuries at the World Cup, but at least one is expected to be fit for the critical European Challenge Cup matches at home against Castres on January 15. Dragons boss Jones further commented that ""they are impactful players who can bring a distinct quality."" He added, ""There's a strong possibility one of them will be back [to face Castres], though I'm uncertain which one.""

The remaining outlets will stay open while KPMG, the appointed administrator, seeks potential buyers. Should these efforts fail, those stores too will cease operations. The company had a workforce of 1,658 individuals.

Morrisons, a supermarket chain, sold My Local to Greybull Capital last year and has since committed to offering positions to former My Local employees. The retailer found it difficult to compete in the fiercely competitive and price-war-ridden grocery market.

Formerly known as Morrisons' M Local, My Local was acquired by Greybull for £25 million. This acquisition was spearheaded by Mike Greene, an experienced figure in retail who gained public recognition from his appearance on Channel 4's The Secret Millionaire.

My Local had indicated earlier this month that administrators were alerted to assume control of the business. Just last week, Morrisons extended a helping hand to My Local's staff, proposing job opportunities within its own supermarkets in the event of store closures.

Mike Greene expressed his regret, stating that the past nine months constituted ""one of the toughest retail trading periods"" he had ever encountered, with My Local confronting ""intense competition."" He added that the management team was ""unable to return the business to profitability,"" for which he was ""truly sorry.""

Mark Orton, a partner at KPMG and joint administrator, commented that the management faced ""tough trading conditions,"" and despite their ""best efforts to improve performance,"" My Local ultimately ""was unable to return to viability."" He confirmed that while most stores have now ceased operations, KPMG is engaged in ""active discussions with a number of interested parties"" regarding both the 32 remaining operational premises and a select few that have already shut down.

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,1163,"A study published in the Journal of Aesthetic Nursing reveals a rising inclination among individuals under 25 to receive anti-wrinkle injections. However, the findings indicate that such ""frozen faces"" might impede young people's ability to fully develop emotional expression. A prominent UK plastic surgery association deems the cosmetic use of Botox in teenagers to be ""morally wrong."" Botox, and similar neurotoxins, function by temporarily immobilizing muscles in the upper facial region, thereby diminishing wrinkles that appear during frowning.

Helen Collier, the nurse practitioner who conducted this research, attributes young people's aspiration for an ""inexpressive frozen face"" to the influence of reality television and celebrity culture. She highlights the widely recognized psychological concept of the facial feedback hypothesis, which posits that adolescents acquire social interaction skills by imitating others' facial expressions. Collier states that ""our capacity as human beings to exhibit a broad spectrum of emotions is highly reliant on facial expressions."" She adds that ""emotions like empathy and sympathy are vital for our survival and for developing into self-assured, communicative adults."" Nevertheless, she cautions that an increasing number of young individuals with ""blank-faced"" appearances might impair their capability to accurately express feelings. She warns, ""Eliminating these expressions could impede their emotional and social maturation.""

The study advocates for medical professionals to employ assessment instruments to determine if there are clear clinical justifications for administering Botox. While various assessment scales exist, evaluating factors such as skin thickness, sun damage, and wrinkle depth, experts caution that certain Botox clinics prioritize financial profit over patient well-being. Ms. Collier encourages therapists to devote time to enhancing young people's self-confidence instead of resorting to injections. She further states that ""although the majority of the toxin's effects are temporary, studies indicate that muscles may not fully recover from the injections."" She stresses, ""It is crucial to comprehend the repercussions of initiating treatments at too young an age.""

Dr. Michael Lewis, a psychology researcher at Cardiff University, explains that ""the expressions we form on our faces influence the emotions we experience."" He elaborates, ""We smile due to happiness, yet smiling also generates happiness."" He concludes that ""medications like Botox inhibit a patient's ability to create specific expressions, potentially impacting our natural process of learning to feel emotions."" Rajiv Grover, president of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, asserts that ""administering Botox to teenagers for cosmetic reasons is ethically indefensible and something no responsible practitioner would undertake."" He warns, ""This practice can only intensify body image concerns during a sensitive developmental period.""

Officials reported that while the damage was superficial, it represented a profound lack of respect. It is believed that the vandals utilized breeze blocks from the site itself in an attempt to scale the inside of the monument.

Nicky Barr, the centre's director, observed that the perpetrators had likely cut through a perimeter fence, with scuff marks inside the memorial probably caused by the falling blocks. She expressed immense disappointment, stating, ""It is hugely disappointing that a memorial this county has worked so hard for, that honours the dead of Bomber Command, has been subjected to this kind of abject vandalism."" She also conveyed the immense pride felt for the spire, which locals affectionately call 'our memorial', highlighting the significant effort invested despite its recent construction just a year ago. Barr reiterated the act as a clear sign of disrespect. Furthermore, she warned that anyone attempting to climb the approximately 30-meter high structure, with its paved base, would be putting themselves ""at real risk of injury,"" potentially leading to severe harm and being left stranded.

The spire was officially unveiled in October, with approximately 300 Bomber Command veterans in attendance. During World War Two, 125,000 aircrew served in Bomber Command, undertaking 364,514 operational sorties.

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,1659,"""This Is For My Girls"" was composed by Diane Warren, renowned for her previous hits such as ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" and ""Un-Break My Heart."" She described the song, a forceful ""girl power"" anthem, as a blend of ""We Are the World meets Lady Marmalade."" Obama released the single ahead of her keynote address at the SXSW festival, where she will discuss her 'Let Girls Learn' initiative, aimed at boosting education rates among adolescent girls globally. Following her speech, she will participate in a panel on the initiative alongside several of the song's performers, including Missy Elliott and Diane Warren, joined by Sophia Bush and moderator Queen Latifah.

Musically, ""This Is For My Girls"" features energetic horn accents and a driving drum beat, creating a somewhat militaristic feel. Its lyrics largely consist of familiar empowerment phrases—for instance, ""Don't take nothing from nobody,"" ""It's all about respect,"" and ""Stand strong forever""—which have been common in female-led R&B since the early 2000s. Additional vocalists on the track include Janelle Monae, ""Glee"" actress Lea Michele, Disney star Zendaya, 16-year-old Motown artist Jadagrace, and Beyoncé's mentees Chloe & Halle. All participating artists waived their fees, ensuring proceeds benefit the 'Let Girls Learn' campaign directly.

Warren told Billboard that ""We haven't had an anthem like this in a while,"" explaining her vision for the record involved ""all these different women, never just one girl singing on it."" She further remarked that ""With Kelly Rowland on it, it's almost like an updated Destiny's Child record,"" and voiced her hope that it ""can be a huge worldwide anthem."" The single is exclusively available on iTunes, and Obama's SXSW speech will be live-streamed on makers.com from 16:00 GMT.",1,1,True

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,1938,"The 19-year-old Harry Dearden and Paul Horton (41) forged an 85-run opening partnership before Glamorgan swiftly claimed three wickets, two of which were taken by young Lukas Carey. Dearden then spearheaded a valuable 90-run stand with Mark Pettini (who remained 63 not out) until spinner Andrew Salter dismissed him. Under the floodlights, Pettini then guided the Foxes to secure their second batting point. Despite being dropped when he had just one run and narrowly escaping two potential run-outs, Dearden’s resilient vigil lasted 211 balls. This was a gritty batting display from the home side, who were asked to bat first in a contest between two teams that had both suffered significant defeats in their opening two fixtures. Salter secured his second wicket, bowling Cameron Delport for 20, after which Pettini and Lewis Hill rapidly added 73 runs, capitalising on the new ball.

Speaking to BBC Radio Leicester, Leicestershire’s Harry Dearden commented: ""I'm incredibly proud of achieving my career-best score. While I had hoped to reach a century, I'm still very proud of this performance, which has made it a truly positive day for us. The conditions were challenging early on, with the ball moving off the pitch and swinging. The key was to face as many deliveries as possible to settle in, and it was a tough contest against their opening bowlers. My focus was on digging deep and maintaining maximum discipline. Batting with Horts (Paul Horton) is beneficial as his experience provides a calming influence, and it's also excellent to bat alongside Mark (Pettini) because he helps you stay balanced.""

Glamorgan spinner Andrew Salter shared his thoughts with BBC Wales Sport: ""I'm pleased to have taken those two wickets, though it wasn't surprising that there wasn't much spin – one delivery went straight through, and the other, a bit fuller, found some rough. My primary aim was to control the scoring rate, believing that sustained pressure would eventually yield rewards. Therefore, I hope my services won't be required significantly more in this first innings. Overall, our bowling unit performed exceptionally well for most of the day; Lukas (Carey) was outstanding at the start. The run-rate was kept to 2.6 for a significant portion of the day, and it was only towards the close that they managed to increase their scoring.""",1,0,False

Key routes impacted included the A82 at Altnafeadh and the A9 at Drumochter.

The Met Office advised the public to ""be aware"" of potentially challenging driving conditions throughout the day, which could lead to localised transport disruption. They explained that a cold, showery westerly airflow was expected across Scotland, with low-pressure troughs delivering extensive and heavy wintry showers. While snow was predicted mainly for higher elevations, more intense showers might occasionally bring it down to lower levels.

Among the areas experiencing significant snowfall was the Cairngorms region. Notably, the Highland Wildlife Park, situated in Kincraig near Aviemore, is home to three polar bears: two males named Arktos and Walker, and a female called Victoria.

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_20_80,2841,"Manchester United's new £75m signing, 24-year-old Belgian striker Romelu Lukaku, netted the winning goal seven minutes before halftime. This followed Henrikh Mkhitaryan's earlier equaliser, after United had initially conceded in the 20th minute. The match also saw United suffer setbacks with Juan Mata's injury and Antonio Valencia's red card.

Manager Mourinho commented that while Lukaku's goal was ""nice for him,"" it held little importance to him personally. He added, ""I told him I love what he does,"" praising the striker's assists, movement, and ability to hold up the ball, concluding, ""I like everything he does.""

Mata's departure was due to a strong challenge from Sebastian Saucedo, though he's only expected to miss up to a week of play. Later, Valencia received a red card for a tackle on Saucedo. Referee Allen Chapman initially consulted with Mourinho before finally sending off the Ecuadorian. Mourinho explained the delay: ""The referee asked me to change the players and I didn't because I don't agree with the card."" The Old Trafford manager further claimed Saucedo had been ""really aggressive with what happened to Mata and some other actions where he was a bit dangerous,"" but dismissed it as ""pre-season so no problem - it's a good experience.""

United's next fixture is against rivals Manchester City in Houston on Friday morning UK time (02:30 BST).

BBC Sport's Simon Stone in Utah commented on the incident, suggesting referee Allen Chapman was compelled to act after Valencia's forceful tackle on Saucedo. Chapman, notable as the first video assistant referee to make a live decision in a 2016 USL game, reportedly first glanced at Jose Mourinho. After ensuring Saucedo was attended to, he approached the United manager, requesting Valencia be substituted, seemingly cautious about dismissing a player in a friendly. When Mourinho declined, Chapman, ""almost apologetically,"" proceeded to issue the red card to the Ecuadorian.",1,0,False
