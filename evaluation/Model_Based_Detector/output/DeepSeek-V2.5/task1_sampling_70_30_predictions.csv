Jones indicated this could sideline him for several months, a considerable blow given his excellent current form and his rising challenge for a spot in the national team, vying with Dan Biggar. Additionally, scrum-half Sarel Pretorius also departed the Liberty Stadium pitch due to a recurring calf problem.

However, the Dragons anticipate the return of Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan later this month. These Wales internationals have been out of action since suffering shoulder injuries at the World Cup, but at least one is expected to be fit for the critical European Challenge Cup matches at home against Castres on January 15. Dragons boss Jones further commented that ""they are impactful players who can bring a distinct quality."" He added, ""There's a strong possibility one of them will be back [to face Castres], though I'm uncertain which one.""

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_70_30,2020,"Mr. Mills had served as deputy chairman for the primary ""out"" campaign, officially recognized by the Electoral Commission. He had previously alleged that the campaign was plagued by internal disputes. Reports indicated he was close to resigning in February when Labour MP Kate Hoey joined a competing ""out"" group.

In his letter of resignation, the home shopping executive explained his belief that a robust and independent Labour perspective advocating for leaving the EU would prove more beneficial and effective for the Leave campaign. He noted that he could now fully devote himself to his role as director of Labour Leave, thereby cultivating that distinct voice. He added that, leading up to the 23 June vote, Labour Leave intended to present a powerful and well-reasoned left-of-centre case for Britain's exit from the EU.

The overwhelming majority of Labour Members of Parliament favor Britain remaining within the EU, with only approximately twelve actively campaigning for departure. Former Labour minister Frank Field cautioned the party that its stance on remaining in the EU risked alienating a significant number of voters, potentially losing them to UKIP. Mr. Mills, who played a key role in the 1975 referendum campaign against European Economic Community membership, has also expressed disapproval of Jeremy Corbyn's decision to support staying in.

Mr. Mills voiced his hope that his choice would be a transformative initial step in encouraging Labour supporters, who are still undecided, to vote Leave in June to secure a better, fairer future for the country. He also stated that Labour Leave would continue its collaboration with Vote Leave, as well as other pro-exit campaigns across the spectrum, to ensure a stronger future for the UK outside the EU.

Vote Leave was the organization chosen by the Electoral Commission to spearhead the argument for Britain's withdrawal from the European Union. It is led by prominent Conservative figures Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, alongside Labour MP Gisela Stuart, and receives backing from Liberal Democrat and UKIP personalities, as well as business professionals.

Concurrently, his younger brother, James, has been named co-chief operating officer for 21st Century Fox. This appointment comes after James resigned from his role as executive chairman of News International in 2012, following the phone hacking scandal.

News Corp is recognized as a major global media entity, owning newspapers such as The Times, The Sun, and The Wall Street Journal. News Corp and 21st Century Fox underwent a corporate split in 2013. The latter company's portfolio includes the US broadcaster Fox News and British Sky Broadcasting in the UK.

Rupert Murdoch, who recently finalized a notable divorce from Wendi Deng, described Lachlan as a ""talented executive"" possessing extensive business knowledge. Lachlan will be reporting directly to Chase Carey, who serves as 21st Century Fox's chief executive. Rupert expressed his pleasure regarding Lachlan's return to a leadership position, stating his son would collaborate closely with him, Chase, James, and the board to ensure future growth. He also conveyed his satisfaction in elevating James to his new ""important role.""

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_70_30,2876,"Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar's statements came just hours after top military operational commanders of India and Pakistan agreed to reduce mounting tensions. This development follows fatal exchanges along the border last week, which have plunged the two neighbouring countries into their most severe crisis since the 2008 Mumbai attacks, widely attributed to Pakistan-based militants.

Ms. Khar's office advised against aggressive remarks from military and political leaders across the border that escalate tensions. Instead, it suggested that both nations should engage in discussions concerning all issues related to the Line of Control (LoC) to reinforce adherence to the ceasefire. AFP quoted her saying the recent border skirmishes ""created questions,"" and affirmed Pakistan's openness to dialogue between foreign ministers to resolve the dispute. India has not yet responded to Ms. Khar's comments.

On Wednesday, Pakistan's director of military operations consented to de-escalation after contacting his Indian counterpart to ""strongly protest"" an alleged ""ceasefire violation"" by Indian troops that killed a Pakistani soldier along the LoC on Tuesday night. India has denied this accusation, which follows other incidents last week where two Indian and two Pakistani soldiers lost their lives. An Indian army spokesman, Col Jagdeep Dahiya, informed the BBC that the Pakistani commander affirmed issuing strict directives to troops stationed at the LoC to uphold the ceasefire established in 2003.

Both sides deny provoking the recent clashes, amidst fears, as reported by the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi, that a nascent peace initiative, underway since last February, could unravel. Earlier, on Tuesday, Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had labeled the killing of Indian soldiers last week – with India alleging one was beheaded – as ""unacceptable.""

DeepSeek-V2.5,task1_sampling_70_30,2982,"In 2014, Kim Lennon alleged rampant drug smuggling at Lewes Prison, likening its sections to a ""war zone."" She was dismissed earlier this week after disciplinary proceedings but affirmed her intention to appeal and her lack of regret for speaking out. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ), however, asserted that Ms. Lennon's termination was not due to her whistleblower status.

Ms. Lennon had claimed in August 2014 that the drug Spice was being illicitly introduced into the jail. She explained that daily cell checks by officers were supposed to occur, but insufficient staff made this impossible, causing her to fear serious injury to an inmate or officer. At the time, the Prison Service denied unsafe staffing levels and stated a ""zero-tolerance approach"" to illegal substances.

Ms. Lennon's suspension occurred after she spoke with The Argus newspaper and the BBC. She stated that while speaking out had caused her significant distress, she had no regrets, adding that frontline officers are too afraid to speak due to potential repercussions. She lamented that she loved her job and felt she was being punished for doing what was right. She indicated her intention to appeal, but said she was approaching it one day at a time.

The MoJ declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of Ms. Lennon's dismissal. In a statement, the MoJ added that they did not wish to prejudice a possible appeal and emphasized their extremely serious approach to staff discipline. They further stated that any unprofessional behavior would be immediately investigated, leading to strong action, with serious wrongdoing being referred to the police. Disciplinary measures, they clarified, could range from a verbal warning to dismissal.",1,0,False
