Pilot Officer Harold Penketh, from Brighton, did not bail out and died.
The Spitfire remains were found after a geophysical survey of the area. It is hoped the recovered parts will be put on public display.
The cause of the crash was never fully established, although witnesses said the Mk 1A Spitfire X4583 broke formation and nose-dived into farmland in the village of Holme, south of Peterborough.
An investigation concluded either the pilot's oxygen system failed or there was a physical failure of the plane.
Pilot Officer Penketh, 20, made no attempt to use his parachute. His body was recovered from the wreckage and returned to his family.
The ""enormous crater"" created by the Spitfire quickly filled with water as the water table in the area is high, eyewitness John Bliss, who was a child at the time, said.
The spitfire remains have lain in their watery grave for 75 years.
The crash site was located after a geophysical survey and metal detecting carried out by Cranfield University in August.
The excavation, which started on Monday and is expected to take a week, is being led by Oxford Archaeology East.
The remains, which are still the property of the Ministry of Defence, will be cleaned and documented. Some are expected to be put on display later this month.

The killer stabbed him with the 25in (63cm) serrated blade after leaping off a stolen moped, the Old Bailey heard.
The 17-year-old, who cannot be named due to his age, was cleared of murder. He will be sentenced on 21 April.
Mr Appleton, a college student from Islington, had been with friends when his attacker jumped off the back of a scooter, pulled out the weapon and chased after the victim and his friends, the jury heard.
He was stabbed repeatedly after tripping and falling. The cause of his death was shock and haemorrhage due to a stab wound to the chest, police said.
The Metropolitan Police has issued guidance about 'zombie' knives, advising that this is how certain ornate knives are currently being marketed. The force says:
Children were playing in the park at the time of the attack.
As the killer was ridden from the scene, the court heard he shouted out ""RP"" - standing for Red Pitch, a rival to a gang in the Nightingale Park area.
The alleged getaway rider, 17, was cleared of murder while another boy, also 17, was found not guilty of conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm.
After the machete attack, the killer fled to Bristol and tried to fly to Malaga in Spain, but was arrested when he returned to London to lie low.
In his defence, the killer said he had come under attack when he went to snatch back his bicycle which had been stolen by another boy.
The court heard he had a previous conviction for possessing a blade after being caught with a lock-knife in a McDonald's restaurant a year before the killing.

Under South African law, sex with someone under 16 is classed as rape whether consensual or not.
BBC Southern Africa correspondent Karen Allen says the family of South Africa's first black president have found themselves constantly in the public spotlight.

Kimi-K2-Instruct,task2_sampling_50_50,637,"Ashley Broomhall trekked to the summit of 3,560ft (1,085m) Snowdon in Snowdonia before tackling Ben Nevis.
It took him seven hours to walk up and down the 4,406ft (1,344m) Scottish peak near Fort William. On the way up he had a snowball fight with other walkers.
He now plans to walk 3,208ft (978m) Scafell Pike in the Lake District.
Mr Broomhall, from Whitchurch in Shropshire, has been doing the walks to raise money for Cancer Research UK.
He set himself the peaks challenge after his mother was diagnosed with cancer.
The 28-year-old has been a member of Star Wars costuming club the 501st UK Garrison for more than five years.
Members attend events across the UK dressed in ""movie-accurate"" costumes to raise funds for charity.
But Mr Broomhall had to make some modifications to his outfit to make it move more freely on the ascents and descents of Snowdon and Ben Nevis, which were done this summer.
For safety reasons, he wore walking boots because his costume footwear was not suitable for the terrain involved and was accompanied by friends.
Dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper and carrying a UK Garrison flag, Mr Broomhall said he drew more than his fair share of funny looks tackling Ben Nevis, Scotland highest Munro and Britain's tallest mountain.
He said: ""We had been confusing a lot of other climbers along the way as a stormtrooper was the last thing they had been expecting to see climbing Ben Nevis.
""We handed out cards and told them my tale and they offered nothing but the most vocal support.""
Mr Broomhall also received donations from other walkers.
Higher up Ben Nevis he had to negotiate thigh-deep snow.
At the first of these snowfields there was some light relief when he and his walking companion had a snowball fight with other walkers.
Mr Broomhall said: ""The last snowfield held the summit and, with my heart swelling with pride, I let the flag fly and charged on to the summit.
""We had made it. It was brilliant and I was so happy at making it after all the struggles and rallying needed to get myself there.
""I was greeted by a cheer from the climbers there and planted the flag on the summit itself claiming it for the Empire.""
He added: ""I love Scotland and I love Munros and this was a challenge that I enjoyed doing.

The Campaign Against Antisemitism has also called for Fury to be banned and complained to the British Boxing Board of Control.
The undefeated 27-year-old, who took the WBA and WBO heavyweight titles from Klitschko in their first bout, later said he was sorry for causing offence and promised to improve his behaviour ""as an ambassador of British boxing"".

Kimi-K2-Instruct,task2_sampling_50_50,862,"It is understood the Hammers will raise their offer for the player who began his career at the east London club.
Defoe, 34, has scored 11 goals in 21 appearances for the Premier League strugglers this season.
His latest goals came on Monday as Sunderland twice fought from a goal down to draw 2-2 with in-form Liverpool, which left manager David Moyes's side in 18th position.
Defoe's senior career began at West Ham before he moved to rivals Tottenham in a ¬£7m deal in 2004, with striker Bobby Zamora going the other way. A ¬£7.5m move to Portsmouth followed in January 2008 before he returned to Spurs the following year for ¬£15m.
Defoe made a surprise move to Canadian team Toronto FC in 2014 before he was  lured to Sunderland in 2015 by former Black Cats boss and ex-Spurs team-mate Gus Poyet.
BBC Radio 5 live's chief football correspondent Ian Dennis
West Ham will return to test the resolve of Sunderland, but it's unthinkable the Black Cats can afford to sell Defoe given their precarious position.
David Moyes recently described Defoe as ""priceless"" and his goals will be the difference as to whether they can preserve their top-flight status.
Premium and proven goalscorers are in short supply which is why West Ham themselves are looking at the 34-year-old.
They say money talks but Defoe is invaluable to Sunderland's cause.",0,0,True

Kimi-K2-Instruct,task2_sampling_50_50,987,"Kathryn Smith said she received ¬£52 a week in income support , some of which was used to buy the Class B substance . Jurors previously heard she was concerned 21 - month - old Ayeeshia Jane Smith may have had a seizure after taking drugs kept at the house . Ms Smith and ex - partner Matthew Rigby both deny murder . More on this and other stories from Stoke and Staffordshire The toddler , known as AJ , died in 2014 at the family home in St Giles Road, Burton-upon-Trent, following what the prosecution described as a ""terrible assault"". The court heard that AJ suffered ""catastrophic"" injuries, including a lacerated heart and internal bleeding, consistent with a severe impact. Post-mortem examinations revealed that Ayeeshia Jane Smith also had historic injuries, including a previous brain bleed and fractures to her ribs, consistent with her having been subjected to non-accidental harm on more than one occasion before her death.

Opening the prosecution's case, Christopher Hotten QC told the jury that both Ms Smith, 23, and Matthew Rigby, 21, were responsible for the fatal injuries inflicted upon AJ. He alleged that the couple, who were in a volatile relationship, had engaged in a ""joint enterprise"" to inflict serious harm, or that one had caused the injuries while the other failed to protect the child. The jury was presented with evidence of a chaotic household where drug use, including cannabis, was prevalent. Ms Smith's admission about using her limited income support to fund drug purchases underlined the difficult environment AJ was living in. The prosecution highlighted texts and calls between Ms Smith and Rigby in the hours leading up to AJ's death, which painted a picture of tension and concern about AJ's health, specifically the worry that she may have ingested drugs.

During cross-examination, Ms Smith maintained her innocence, accusing Matthew Rigby of being the one who inflicted the fatal injuries. She claimed she had briefly left the room and returned to find AJ unresponsive. Conversely, Rigby's defence team argued that it was Ms Smith who was responsible, suggesting she had a history of losing her temper and being violent. The court heard conflicting accounts from both defendants, each attempting to shift blame onto the other. Social services had been involved with the family prior to AJ's death, and concerns about the child's welfare had been raised on multiple occasions. Evidence presented included records of these interventions and assessments. The trial, presided over by Mr Justice Haddon-Cave at Stafford Crown Court, continues to hear from medical experts, police officers, and other witnesses who were involved in the investigation. The jury's task is to determine who was responsible for the tragic death of Ayeeshia Jane Smith, considering the complex web of evidence and conflicting narratives presented by the defence and prosecution.

The facial injuries sustained by both individuals, while not life-threatening, required medical attention and have caused significant distress.""

Detective Inspector McFarlane urged anyone who was in the Ardencraig Quadrant or Ardencraig Drive areas of Castlemilk, Glasgow, around the time of the incident to come forward. ""We are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen individuals acting suspiciously in the vicinity, or who may have dashcam footage or private CCTV that could assist our investigation,"" he added.

We understand that residents in Castlemilk will be concerned by this news, and I want to reassure the community that extensive enquiries are underway.

United then lost Juan Mata to injury and Antonio Valencia to a red card . "" [ Lukaku 's goal ] is nice for him but not important for me , "" said Mourinho . "" I told him that what's important is the collective result, the three points, not his personal tally. His goal was crucial, yes, but it came in a game where we faced significant challenges, including going behind, losing Juan Mata to injury, and Antonio Valencia to a red card. These moments test a team's resilience, and I'm pleased with how we fought to get the win, but we must learn from the mistakes that put us in those difficult positions. The injury to Juan Mata is a big concern. He is a key player for us, and his creativity will be missed. We will assess the extent of the injury, but it did not look good. As for Antonio Valencia's red card, it was a moment of indiscipline that he knows was unnecessary. An experienced player should not make such a mistake, leaving his team with ten men and missing the next match. We cannot afford these kinds of errors if we want to compete for major honours.

Romelu knows my expectations are high, not just for scoring goals, but for his all-round contribution. I want to see him link up play, press from the front, and be constantly involved in our attacking build-up, not just waiting for chances. Goals are a consequence of doing everything else correctly. He has the potential to be a complete forward for Manchester United, and we will continue to work on all aspects of his game. The team showed character to get the win after so many setbacks, including Henrikh Mkhitaryan's equaliser being cancelled out earlier before we recovered. However, the overall performance was not perfect. We gave them too much space at times and should have been more clinical to finish the game off sooner. We must improve consistently. We take the three points, analyse where we need to get better, and immediately focus on the next challenge. The season is long, and we need every player to maintain focus, discipline, and deliver high-level performances without errors that hurt the team.",1,1,True

Sheeran's comeback follows a ""gap year"" where he removed himself from social media, making space to write his third album, √É¬∑ (Divide).
Fans were clearly hungry for new material, as the star set several streaming records over the course of the week.
Shape Of You's bouncy, uptempo pop was the bigger hit, notching up 13.4 million streams - smashing the record Drake set last summer, when One Dance was streamed 8.9 million in a single week.
Castle On The Hill, built around a chiming, U2-style guitar riff, also beat Drake's tally, with 11.07 million streams.

Hundreds of unique films have been released to the public to view online for free after the British Film Institute (BFI) unlocked its archive as part of a major history project, From Britain On Film.
Royal visits and Lord Mayor's shows are documented in the collection, as is the tale of Churchill's appearance in Belfast when he addressed an audience of nationalists in Celtic Park and gave his support to Home Rule.
There are also dozens of travelogues that were used to sell Northern Ireland to tourists in Great Britain and the United States, helping to boost tourism in the years before the Troubles.
And in sport, the 1930 Ulster Tourist Trophy race held at the Ards circuit in County Down is captured on camera. The event attracted thousands of spectators and commanded the attention of the motorsport world.
The real gems, however, are found in the footage of ordinary people doing extraordinary things.
Films of people at work in the spinning mills and constructing the M1 at Stockman's Lane in Belfast shows Northern Ireland's industry at its booming best.
Another film captures the first time Northern Ireland hosted the World Ploughing Championships, and fittingly it is a local man who takes the title.
The colour footage from the 1959 competition in Armoy, County Antrim, shows Lawrence McMillan's crowning moment as he gets his hands on the Golden Plough.
But perhaps most revealing of all is a 1938 recording of the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.
It gives a rare glimpse into the casualty department and operating theatres as they were then, 10 years before the foundation of the National Health Service.
While medicine has advanced considerably in the eight decades since then, some aspects of healthcare in Northern Ireland appear to remain unchanged - the film ends with an appeal from the chairman of the hospital's management board to reduce waiting lists.
Francis Jones, of Northern Ireland Screen, which gathered much of the footage, said the aim of the project was to preserve delicate film that could otherwise be lost.
""There is a pure nostalgia value to film. It's different to reading a textbook or history book,"" he added.
""To actually see the film has that kind of visceral appeal and really strikes a chord with people.""

Meanwhile , younger son James was appointed co - chief operating officer at 21st Century Fox . After the phone hacking scandal , which rocked the Murdoch empire and led to the closure of the News of the World, James Murdoch had faced intense scrutiny over his leadership at News International, the UK newspaper arm of News Corp. His reputation was significantly tarnished, and the controversy derailed 21st Century Fox's (then News Corporation's) bid to fully acquire BSkyB. This period was widely seen as a major crisis for the family business, leading ultimately to the dramatic split of the old News Corporation into two distinct entities: the new News Corp, housing the publishing assets, and 21st Century Fox, holding the more lucrative entertainment businesses. James's appointment as co-chief operating officer at 21st Century Fox, alongside his brother's elevated role, signaled a strategic shift by Rupert Murdoch to solidify the succession plan and perhaps rehabilitate James's image within the company's more profitable divisions.

If administrator KPMG can not find buyers , the remaining stores will also shut . The chain employed 1,658 people . The chain was sold to Greybull Capital last year by supermarket Morrisons , which has said it would offer jobs to ex - My Local staff . It has struggled since being acquired by private equity firm Greybull Capital in September 2015. The chain, formerly Morrisons M Local, was sold off by the supermarket giant as part of a strategic shift away from smaller convenience formats to focus on its larger superstores. At the time of the sale, Morrisons provided significant financial support to Greybull Capital, including a loan of up to £25 million, to help stabilize the business and facilitate its turnaround. However, the investment proved insufficient to reverse its fortunes in an increasingly competitive market dominated by established players like Tesco Express and Sainsbury's Local, as well as discounters.

The challenges faced by the former Morrisons' M Local stores under Greybull Capital’s stewardship were multifaceted. High operating costs, coupled with intense price competition and shifts in consumer shopping habits, created a difficult trading environment. Despite efforts to rebrand and reposition the stores as ‘My Local’, aiming for a community-focused offering, the chain failed to gain significant traction or achieve sustainable profitability. The decision to appoint KPMG as administrators came after a period of intense financial pressure, leaving no viable path forward without significant restructuring.

KPMG's immediate priority has been to manage the closure of the 93 unprofitable stores and to seek buyers for the remaining 32. Sources close to the administration process indicate that finding a single buyer for the remaining portfolio might be challenging, suggesting that individual or smaller clusters of stores could be sold off to other retailers or convenience store operators. The closure process will unfortunately result in the loss of a significant number of the 1,658 jobs, though Morrisons' proactive offer to re-employ former My Local staff, where possible, provides some relief to those affected. This gesture by Morrisons highlights its ongoing commitment, having initially established the convenience arm and then divested it.

The collapse of My Local underscores the difficulties even established players face in the convenience sector. For Greybull Capital, this represents a significant setback, adding to their mixed portfolio of investments. The future of the remaining 32 stores hinges entirely on KPMG’s ability to secure buyers within a reasonable timeframe, failing which, they too will inevitably shut, marking the complete disappearance of the My Local brand from the high street, less than a year after its high-profile launch under Greybull.",1,0,False

Kimi-K2-Instruct,task2_sampling_50_50,2390,"The fine print of the deal suggests something slightly different , and shows that GM has in fact taken a hit of up to ¬£6bn in order to get shot of Vauxhall and Opel . First , a big chunk of the price - three - quarters of a billion pounds - is not for car plants , but for loans taken out by the owners of Opel and Vauxhall This unusual arrangement highlights that rather than simply selling an asset, GM is effectively paying to divest itself of a long-standing financial burden. The bulk of the £6bn charge, however, stems from the substantial pension liabilities that GM has chosen to retain rather than offload to Peugeot. Estimates place GM's retention of pension obligations for Vauxhall and Opel employees at well over £5bn, reflecting the enormous cost of legacy commitments built up over decades. This decision, made in Detroit, underscores GM's strategic imperative to clear its balance sheet of European losses that have plagued its financial performance for years. By retaining these liabilities, GM avoids the potentially complex and protracted negotiations that would have been required to transfer them to Peugeot, thereby expediting the sale and providing a clean break.

The deal, therefore, is less about GM selling a profitable division and more about a costly exit from a market where it has struggled to compete consistently. For Peugeot, this acquisition of Vauxhall and Opel presents an opportunity to significantly increase its market share in Europe and achieve substantial economies of scale. However, it also means inheriting a business that has been unprofitable for nearly two decades, requiring significant restructuring and investment to turn around. The challenge for Peugeot will be to integrate the Vauxhall and Opel operations efficiently, streamline production, and reduce costs without alienating the workforce or diluting the brands' appeal. The focus for Vauxhall under its new ownership will be on platform sharing with Peugeot models, standardizing components, and rationalizing the product portfolio to improve profitability. This move signals a definitive shift in GM's global strategy, allowing it to concentrate resources on more lucrative markets like North America and China, and invest heavily in future technologies such as electric and autonomous vehicles. The severance of ties with Vauxhall and Opel frees up capital and management attention, enabling GM to pursue its growth ambitions elsewhere, even if the price of freedom came with a hefty £6bn cheque.",1,0,False

In contrast to positive responses , some users expressed confusion while others ridiculed the message . One questioned whether the FA Cup winner was "" drunk "" The confusion stemmed from a misunderstanding of the Welsh phrase ""un flwyddyn heddiw."" While perfectly natural and idiomatic Welsh for marking an anniversary – meaning ""one year today"" – many English-speaking social media users interpreted it literally, failing to grasp its linguistic nuance. Aaron Ramsey, a proud Welshman, had posted the picture from his 2014 wedding on what was clearly his first anniversary in 2015. However, some users assumed the caption meant the picture itself was exactly one year old, which made no sense for a 2014 wedding photo. Others simply couldn't reconcile a 2014 event with a ""one year today"" caption, leading them to believe the FA Cup winner was confused about his own wedding date.

The decision by Mr. Ramsey to use his native tongue, a common practice for the midfielder, was widely misinterpreted. One Twitter user, @rightjudgeiam, sarcastically tweeted, ""Does Aaron Ramsey not know how long a year is? 2014 wedding, posts 'one year today'. Welsh or not, that's just bad maths."" This reaction highlighted a lack of understanding regarding the traditional use of such anniversary greetings in Welsh culture. The ridicule often stemmed from assumptions that he was implying the 2014 wedding had only happened ""one year today"" relative to the 2015 post. This episode underscored the pitfalls of social media, where context, linguistic differences, and cultural nuances are easily lost, turning an innocent, culturally specific message into a subject of online amusement and mockery.",1,1,True

The penalty decision itself was debatable, yes, but our reaction to it and the subsequent equaliser was simply non-existent. We talk about showing character and resilience, but today we displayed very little of it when it truly mattered most. We need to be far more professional, more focused, and much more streetwise. The players have to grasp the fact that every single minute of every game counts, especially when you are fighting for every point in a demanding division like this. We allowed ourselves to be severely punished for a clear lack of concentration and game management. This isn't the first time we've let a strong position slip, and it's a worrying pattern that we absolutely, unequivocally must break. It's simply not good enough.

We're creating enough chances, which is a positive, but we're conceding soft goals at the other end. That combination is a recipe for disaster. We need to be tougher, both physically and mentally, to grind out results.

Mr Groome's disappearance was initially treated as a missing person's inquiry but a murder investigation was launched in 2012.
Thaxter, 39, and his mother, June Buttle, were first arrested in 2013.
Buttle was charged the following year but there was insufficient evidence to charge her son at the time.
The 57-year-old, of Doncaster, was jailed in 2015 for 16 years after pleading guilty to manslaughter, conspiracy to prevent a burial and fraud.
Temp Det Ch Supt Lisa Ray, of South Yorkshire Police, said she hoped the pair would do the ""decent thing"" by telling Mr Groome's family where his body was.
In a statement, his relatives described him as a ""larger-than-life character"", who loved to travel.

SSI took over the former Tata Steel complex after it was mothballed in 2010 and employs almost 2,000 people.
Ms Soubry said EU rules meant state cash could not be directly used to support British steel production.
SSI chief operating officer Cornelius Louwrens called on the government to ""take action rather than use just words"" to help ensure the plant survives.
He said: ""Other European countries are finding ways to support their steel industries because they believe it is so important.""
He urged ministers to approve the underwriting of ""key projects"" to enable it to secure commercial loans, as well as reduce business rates and ease restrictions linked to CO2 emissions.
But, Ms Soubry said: ""There are extremely strict state aid rules, which especially apply to the steel industry, so we are limited as to what we can do.
""We can put money into things like research and development. But simply giving a loan or underwriting things, we cannot do.
""Things are extremely difficult at SSI, but our hands are tied. However, we will continue to work with the company and the trade unions, but the underlying problem in all of this is that there is an overproduction of steel across the world.

The BBBofC met to discuss the matter on Wednesday before informing Fury that he must meet with the board . The Briton has denied he is a homophobe and claimed he is "" uniting the world "" This upcoming meeting with the British Boxing Board of Control is expected to be a crucial one, as the organization seeks to address the widespread condemnation sparked by the boxer’s controversial remarks. Public outcry intensified following comments where Fury equated homosexuality and abortion with the end of the world, and made disparaging remarks about women.

The firestorm led to significant pressure. Over 140,000 people signed an online petition calling for the Briton to be removed from the BBC Sports Personality of the Year shortlist. Despite the controversy, the BBC maintained Fury would remain on the list, citing that the decision was based on sporting achievement. This stance further fueled debate about the responsibility of public figures.

Furthermore, his comments prompted an investigation by Greater Manchester Police (GMP). The police force confirmed they had received complaints regarding his comments, which were being assessed for potential hate crime implications. While the GMP later clarified no specific crime had been recorded, the police inquiry underscored the seriousness with which his remarks were viewed.

Fury, who secured his world titles after defeating Wladimir Klitschko, has consistently maintained that his comments were taken out of context and that he is not a prejudiced individual, insisting he respects all people. Despite his defence, the ongoing controversy has cast a significant shadow over his boxing achievements and raised uncomfortable questions for the sport. The BBBofC meeting is anticipated to clarify whether Fury will face any disciplinary action, ranging from a reprimand to a fine or even a suspension, depending on the Board's assessment of his conduct and compliance with their code of ethics.",1,1,True

The result meant that Vaduz secured a vital away win, maintaining their strong start to the season and leaving the home side frustrated, knowing they had pushed their opponents all the way after a difficult start.

The government chief whip was seen with a massive grin after tonight 's vote . Remember ministers ' climbdown came with a clever kicker , persuading Labour to sign up to their timetable for triggering Article 50 without committing to very much in return The 'clever kicker' was the government’s commitment to publish a Brexit white paper and allow a parliamentary debate on the negotiating strategy before Article 50 is invoked. This strategic concession offered vital political cover for Labour MPs, particularly those representing pro-remain constituencies. It enabled them to vote for the timetable, framing their support as a push for parliamentary scrutiny rather than capitulation to Theresa May’s agenda. This allowed them to appease concerned constituents and avoid accusations of obstructing the democratic will.

For Theresa May, this parliamentary triumph is paramount. It solidifies her authority over the Brexit process, demonstrating her ability to command a Commons majority for her timeline. The chief whip’s satisfaction signalled successful navigation of perilous political currents, momentarily silencing critics. This outcome strengthens May’s hand for complex negotiations with the EU, reinforcing her narrative that the UK is united in its resolve to leave by the deadline. The focus now shifts decisively from the mechanism of triggering Article 50 to defining Britain's future relationship with Europe.

However, deep divisions persist. While Labour’s leadership found a pragmatic way through, many within the party and the broader remain camp remain uneasy. The white paper offers limited real parliamentary power over final Brexit terms. Pro-remain voices will undoubtedly intensify as the immense complexities of disentangling from the EU become clearer, especially regarding single market and customs union access. The coming months will severely test the government’s resolve and party cohesion as Brexit’s true impact unfolds. This vote merely concludes the first chapter, ushering in the far more challenging phase of withdrawal and negotiation.",1,0,False

Kimi-K2-Instruct,task2_sampling_50_50,2765,"Afghanistan's intelligence agency blamed Wednesday's attack on militants allegedly backed by Islamabad.
An Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) statement it could not agree to play against ""a country where terrorists are housed and provided safe havens"".
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) later accused the ACB of ""playing politics"".
Pakistan has rejected an Afghan claim that it was involved the attack in the capital.
A PCB statement added: ""The PCB strongly rejects the baseless allegations levelled by Afghanistan Cricket Board in the wake of the tragic Kabul blast.
""While our sympathies are with the victims and families affected by the tragedy, we reject the irresponsible statement made by the ACB and hereby announce the cancellation of the proposed series between the two countries.
""The informal understanding with ACB last weekend was strictly subject to conducive security conditions in Afghanistan and now stands cancelled because of continuing insecurity and instability there.""
The bomb killed at least 90 people in Kabul, where a Twenty20 match between the two countries was provisionally scheduled to take place later this year.
That match would have been followed by a fixture in Pakistan and a full series at an undetermined date.
However, the ACB statement added that it ""hereby cancel all kinds of cricket matches and initial mutual relationship agreement with the Pakistan Cricket Board"".
Pakistan played a role in the development of cricket in Afghanistan, supplying equipment and arranging fixtures.
But in 2016, Afghanistan's national team shifted its base from Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates to Noida, Delhi, while India's former batsman Lalchand Rajput replaced Pakistan's Inzamam-ul-Haq as their national team coach.
