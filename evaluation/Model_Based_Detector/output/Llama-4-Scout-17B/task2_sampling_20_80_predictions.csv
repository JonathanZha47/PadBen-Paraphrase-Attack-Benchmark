Llama-4-Scout-17B,task2_sampling_20_80,139,"The Citroen driver from Dungannon won three out of the four stages in the Tour de Course . Ogier stayed within touching distance of the Meeke , who is aiming to follow up his dramatic victory in Rally Mexico with another commanding performance in Corsica, a rally known for its challenging asphalt roads and unforgiving corners. His pace in the opening stages clearly demonstrated his intent to build on the momentum gained from Mexico, where a last-gasp surge saw him snatch victory. The Tour de Course, often dubbed the 'Rally of 10,000 Corners', provides a stark contrast to the gravel and altitude of Mexico, demanding pinpoint accuracy and supreme confidence on high-speed tarmac. Meeke, driving his Citroen C3 WRC, seemed perfectly attuned to the demanding conditions, pushing hard from the very first kilometre. His ability to find an extra gear on the demanding Corsican roads left his rivals, especially championship leader Ogier, with little room for error. Ogier, ever the strategist, was playing a waiting game, conserving tyres and monitoring Meeke's incredible rhythm, knowing that any mistake on these narrow, tree-lined roads could be catastrophic. The battle between the two titans was shaping up to be a classic, with Meeke not just fighting for a win but for validation after a mixed start to the season. His victory in Mexico had silenced some critics, but a strong result here in the Tour de Course would solidify his position as a genuine title contender. The focus now shifts to the remaining stages, where the mental and physical demands would only intensify, testing the nerve of both the Dungannon driver and his relentless French pursuer.",1,0,False

Dearden then dominated a stand of 90 with Mark Pettini ( 63 not out ) before being bowled by spinner Andrew Salter . Pettini steered the Foxes to a second batting point underneath the lights . Dearden , who was dropped on one , survived a couple of run - out chances in his lengthy vigil of 145 runs, an innings that anchored Leicestershire's first innings and set a challenging total for Glamorgan. His century, a testament to his resilience and growing maturity, included 18 fours and two sixes, played across more than five hours at the crease. It was an innings of two halves, patiently accumulating runs against the new ball before accelerating with Mark Pettini in a partnership that put the visitors on the back foot. The early scares, being dropped and almost run out, only seemed to steel his resolve, as he focused on building a substantial total for his team. His dismissal by Andrew Salter, a rare lapse in concentration, came from a ball that spun sharply back into him, ending a truly memorable individual performance.

With Dearden gone, Leicestershire still needed to consolidate. Mark Pettini, who had played an excellent supporting role, then took on the mantle of primary aggressor. He found an able partner in Ned Eckersley, and the pair continued to build on the platform Dearden had established. Glamorgan, despite their earlier breakthroughs, found it difficult to dislodge Pettini, whose experience shone through. Lukas Carey, though expensive in patches, continued to pose a threat with his pace and bounce, while Andrew Salter tried to tie down the scoring with his accurate left-arm spin. The Welsh county's bowlers, however, struggled to maintain consistent pressure as the pitch flattened out under the floodlights.

Pettini reached his own well-deserved hundred just before the close of play, guiding Leicestershire past the 400-run mark. They declared their innings at 415 for 7, giving their bowlers a brief spell at Glamorgan's openers before stumps. The declaration was a clear statement of intent, aiming to put Glamorgan under pressure immediately. Glamorgan faced a tricky 10-over period under lights, which proved challenging. Sam Northeast and Nick Selman weathered the initial storm, but the Foxes' new ball bowlers, led by Chris Wright, made them play at everything. Glamorgan ended the day on 28 for 1, having lost Selman cheaply, caught at slip off a superb delivery from Gavin Griffiths. Northeast (15 not out) and Marnus Labuschagne (8 not out) will resume tomorrow, with Glamorgan still trailing by a substantial 387 runs. The match remains finely poised, with Leicestershire holding a clear advantage due to Dearden's heroics and Pettini's late flourish, but Glamorgan will be hoping their strong batting line-up can respond on what appears to be a good batting surface. The early wickets on day two will be crucial for both sides as the contest heats up in this Championship clash.",1,0,False

Llama-4-Scout-17B,task2_sampling_20_80,574,"The Rhodesian Squadron Royal Air Force plane , based at RAF Wittering , crashed at Holme on 22 November 1940 . Pilot Officer Harold Penketh , from Brighton , did not bail out and died . The Spitfire remains were found after a geophysical survey of the area . It is hoped the recovered parts will be put on public display , offering a poignant reminder of the sacrifices made during World War Two.

Pilot Officer Penketh, aged just 20 at the time of the tragedy, was flying a Supermarine Spitfire Mk IIa, a crucial fighter aircraft during the Battle of Britain and its aftermath. While the exact cause of the crash remains unknown, it is speculated that he may have been attempting to steer his damaged aircraft away from the village of Holme, thus preventing further casualties on the ground, a common act of heroism among pilots of that era. His decision not to bail out, despite the clear danger, underscores the immense courage displayed by so many young men in the face of conflict. Harold Penketh's name is commemorated on the Brighton & Hove War Memorial, serving as a permanent tribute to his ultimate sacrifice.

The archaeological team, working closely with aviation historians and military experts, undertook a meticulous excavation following the successful geophysical survey. This state-of-the-art technique had revealed anomalies beneath the surface, consistent with buried metallic objects, leading them directly to the crash site. Over several weeks, a variety of artefacts were carefully unearthed, including fragments of the Spitfire's engine, sections of the fuselage, instrumentation, and personal effects believed to belong to Pilot Officer Penketh. Each piece recovered tells a part of the story, shedding light on the intensity of aerial combat and the grim reality faced by those defending the nation's skies.

The ongoing conservation efforts aim to stabilise and preserve these precious relics. Plans are underway to create an exhibit, potentially at a local museum or a dedicated aviation heritage centre, which will not only showcase the recovered Spitfire components but also tell the personal story of Harold Penketh and the wider context of the Rhodesian Squadron Royal Air Force's operations from RAF Wittering during the war. This display will serve as an educational resource, ensuring that the bravery of individuals like Penketh and the vital role of the Spitfire in Britain's defence are never forgotten. It will allow visitors to connect directly with a piece of history, understanding the profound human cost of freedom and the legacy of the young pilots who flew from bases like RAF Wittering. The community of Brighton, in particular, has expressed a deep interest in honouring one of their own through this significant historical recovery and memorial. The ultimate goal is to provide a fitting and lasting tribute to Pilot Officer Harold Penketh and all who served.",1,0,False

Llama-4-Scout-17B,task2_sampling_20_80,684,"Stefan Appleton , 18 , was with friends when he was attacked in Nightingale Park in Islington on 10 June last year . The killer stabbed him with the 25 in ( 63 cm ) serrated blade after leaping off a stolen moped , the Old Bailey heard . The 17 - year - old , who can not be named due to his age , was cleared of murder . He will be sentenced on 21 April . Mr Appleton , a popular and bright teenager, was an avid football fan and a beloved son and brother. His death sent shockwaves through the Islington community, leaving his family and friends devastated. He was described by those who knew him as a joyful and kind-hearted individual with a promising future ahead of him. The brutal nature of the attack, carried out in a public park, deeply rattled local residents and intensified concerns about knife crime among young people.

The Metropolitan Police launched a comprehensive investigation, meticulously gathering evidence and tracking down the perpetrator. Detectives worked tirelessly to piece together the events leading up to the fatal stabbing. The court heard how the assailant, riding a stolen moped, had pursued Stefan before cornering him in Nightingale Park, close to the area often referred to as the Red Pitch, a popular local recreation spot. The ferocity of the attack, involving a large serrated blade, was a key focus of the prosecution’s case.

During the trial at the Old Bailey, the prosecution argued that the defendant had demonstrated a clear intent to cause serious harm, if not death. However, the defence presented arguments challenging the specific intent required for a murder conviction, leading to the jury’s decision to clear the 17-year-old of murder, finding him guilty of manslaughter instead. This verdict, while acknowledging the defendant’s responsibility for Stefan’s death, has been met with mixed emotions by Stefan’s family, who had campaigned tirelessly for justice. They issued a statement expressing their profound grief and the permanent void left by Stefan’s passing, but also reiterated their commitment to advocating for an end to knife violence.

The sentencing hearing on 21 April will determine the consequences for the teenager who took Stefan’s life. The case has highlighted the urgent need for interventions to prevent similar tragedies and to address the root causes of youth violence in London.

"" Teams are vulnerable after they 've scored . Our game management has got to be a lot better , "" said Keen , whose side whose side, Colchester United, ultimately succumbed to a frustrating 2-1 defeat against Chesterfield. ""It's infuriating to concede almost immediately after you've taken the lead, especially when you have a man advantage for such a significant period of the game,"" Keen lamented, his frustration palpable. ""Macauley Bonne took his goal so well, a really good finish, and that should have been the turning point for us to go on and secure all three points. Instead, we mentally switched off, allowed them back into the game far too easily, and then failed to respond adequately to their eventual winner. The penalty decision itself was debatable, yes, but our reaction to it and the subsequent equaliser was simply non-existent. We talk about showing character and resilience, but today we displayed very little of it when it truly mattered most. We need to be far more professional, more focused, and much more streetwise. The players have to grasp the fact that every single minute of every game counts, especially when you are fighting for every point in a demanding division like this. We allowed ourselves to be severely punished for a clear lack of concentration and game management. This isn't the first time we've let a strong position slip, and it's a worrying pattern that we absolutely, unequivocally must break. It's simply not good enough. We effectively gifted them a point, and ultimately, three. We've got to be more ruthless in seeing games out, both in our attacking play and, crucially, in our defensive discipline. We're creating enough chances, which is a positive, but we're conceding soft goals at the other end. That combination is a recipe for disaster. We need to be tougher, both physically and mentally, to grind out results. This outcome feels like a massive, massive missed opportunity, one that could potentially cost the U's dearly as the season progresses. We simply cannot afford these lapses in concentration if we are to climb the league table and achieve our objectives.",1,0,False

Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Melanie Croy told the jury Mr Capp's ability to form rational judgement was impaired because of his mental illness.
Mr Capp admits killing Mr Thomas but denies murder.
Appearing for the defence, Dr Croy, who works at Ashworth high security hospital where Mr Capp has been detained, said he suffered from an abnormality of mental function, which could diminish his responsibility for Mr Thomas's murder.
Dr Croy told the court Mr Capp suffered from paranoid delusional beliefs and heard two voices in his head.
One, which he describes as Mr Grey, tells him to harm others and himself, the jury was told.
Since he has been at Ashworth hospital, Mr Capp has described voices telling him to kill others with his bare hands, she said.
A second female voice acts as a guardian and gives him advice, the court was told.
Mr Capp told Dr Croy he believed he was being tortured at Cardiff prison in the weeks leading to the killing and thought he was going to be killed.
A different consultant psychiatrist, on behalf of the prosecution, believes Mr Capp has a personality disorder rather than a mental illness.
Dr Phillip Joseph told the jury he believed Mr Capp understood what he was doing when he killed his cellmate.
MrThomas was discovered dead in the cell with a plastic bag wrapped around his head. He had been stabbed 100 times in the neck with a ball point pen.
Mr Capp denies murder on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Human rights group Liberty said the Attorney General had given his family consent to apply to the High Court . An earlier inquest recorded a verdict of suicide on the 20 - year - old soldier . The coroner at a second inquest on Pte Cheryl James , who died at Deepcut in 1995, concluded in 2016 that her death was not suicide but an 'unlawful killing', a landmark overturning of the original finding. Pte James was one of four young soldiers who died from gunshot wounds at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, in Surrey, between 1995 and 2002. The others were Private Geoff Gray, Private James Collinson, and Private Kevin Williams. All four deaths were initially ruled as suicides, leading to years of tenacious campaigning by their families, who consistently maintained that the circumstances surrounding their children's deaths were suspicious and that the original investigations were fundamentally flawed.

The tragic sequence of Deepcut deaths became a national scandal, shining a harsh light on welfare provisions, alleged bullying, and the duty of care within the British Army. Families, often supported by organisations such as Liberty, fought tirelessly to have the original inquest verdicts quashed and new inquiries launched, believing that vital evidence had been overlooked or mishandled. The case of Pte Cheryl James, in particular, gained renewed traction when her parents, Des and Doreen James, secured a fresh inquest following years of arduous legal battles. This second inquest heard compelling evidence of a pervasive culture of fear, harassment, and even alleged sexual exploitation at the barracks, which her family powerfully argued contributed directly to her death.

Similarly, the family of Pte Sean Benton, also found dead at the same Deepcut Barracks in Surrey, has long sought a new inquest into his death. His sister, Tracy Lewis, and other family members have consistently challenged the original suicide verdict, citing numerous inconsistencies in the evidence and a disturbing lack of proper investigation at the time. The recent consent granted by the Attorney General for Pte Benton's family to apply to the High Court for a fresh inquest underscores the profound and ongoing concerns about the integrity of the original inquiries into these tragic deaths.

These landmark cases, driven by the extraordinary persistence and courage of the bereaved families and their dedicated legal teams, have had a profound and lasting impact on the understanding of military deaths and the standards of investigation within the armed forces. They have critically highlighted the urgent need for independent oversight and a transparent justice process when service personnel die in non-combat circumstances. The re-examination of these deeply troubling cases, particularly through the High Court and subsequent new inquests, represents a pivotal moment in the collective quest for truth and accountability, offering a glimmer of hope for long-awaited closure to families who have endured decades of anguish and unanswered questions regarding the deaths of their loved ones at Deepcut and similar military establishments.",1,0,False

Llama-4-Scout-17B,task2_sampling_20_80,1443,"For the first time , MPs have agreed in a vote that we will begin the process of leaving the EU by the end of March . The government chief whip was seen with a massive grin after tonight 's vote . Remember ministers ' climbdown came with a clever kicker , persuading Labour to sign up to their timetable for triggering Article 50 without committing to very much in return The 'clever kicker' was the government’s commitment to publish a Brexit white paper and allow a parliamentary debate on the negotiating strategy before Article 50 is invoked. This strategic concession offered vital political cover for Labour MPs, particularly those representing pro-remain constituencies. It enabled them to vote for the timetable, framing their support as a push for parliamentary scrutiny rather than capitulation to Theresa May’s agenda. This allowed them to appease concerned constituents and avoid accusations of obstructing the democratic will.

For Theresa May, this parliamentary triumph is paramount. It solidifies her authority over the Brexit process, demonstrating her ability to command a Commons majority for her timeline. The chief whip’s satisfaction signalled successful navigation of perilous political currents, momentarily silencing critics. This outcome strengthens May’s hand for complex negotiations with the EU, reinforcing her narrative that the UK is united in its resolve to leave by the deadline. The focus now shifts decisively from the mechanism of triggering Article 50 to defining Britain's future relationship with Europe.

However, deep divisions persist. While Labour’s leadership found a pragmatic way through, many within the party and the broader remain camp remain uneasy. The white paper offers limited real parliamentary power over final Brexit terms. Pro-remain voices will undoubtedly intensify as the immense complexities of disentangling from the EU become clearer, especially regarding single market and customs union access. The coming months will severely test the government’s resolve and party cohesion as Brexit’s true impact unfolds. This vote merely concludes the first chapter, ushering in the far more challenging phase of withdrawal and negotiation.",1,0,False

She stressed that no - one wanted a return to the "" borders of the past "" . Her meeting with Mr Kenny is understood to have focused on the impact of Brexit on British and Irish relations . Earlier in July , shortly after her appointment as the new prime minister , Mrs May spoke to Mr Kenny by telephone and agreed to build on the "" strong, existing relationship"" between their two countries. Mrs. May reiterated her pledge that there would be no return to the hard borders of the past, emphasizing the deep historical, cultural, and economic ties that bind the UK and Ireland. Her discussions in Belfast and Dublin were aimed at understanding the specific concerns of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, as both jurisdictions navigate the unprecedented challenge of Brexit. She acknowledged the unique circumstances of the island of Ireland, where the land border between the UK and the EU would present particular difficulties for trade, freedom of movement, and, crucially, for the delicate peace process established by the Good Friday Agreement.

During her meetings, Mrs. May assured all parties that the UK government was fully committed to protecting the peace agreement in all its dimensions. This commitment, she stressed, included finding practical solutions to the border issue that would respect the integrity of the UK internal market while avoiding any physical infrastructure or checks. She highlighted the need for flexible and imaginative approaches, signalling a willingness to explore innovative customs arrangements and regulatory alignment where necessary to prevent a disruptive outcome for the cross-border economy. The prime minister underscored the importance of ensuring that Northern Ireland’s unique position was reflected in the ongoing Brexit negotiations with the European Union, making it clear that the needs of Northern Ireland would be a priority for her government.

Mr. Kenny, for his part, conveyed Ireland’s significant concerns regarding the potential impact of Brexit, particularly the re-emergence of a hard border on the island. He stressed the importance of maintaining the Common Travel Area, protecting the rights of citizens, and safeguarding the integrated all-island economy, which has flourished since the peace agreement. Mr. Kenny reiterated Ireland's desire for a comprehensive and ambitious future relationship between the UK and the EU, one that would minimise disruption and uphold the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. He also emphasised the unique role of the Republic of Ireland as an EU member state, committed to the single market and customs union, yet also bound by its shared history and geography with the UK and Northern Ireland. Both leaders recognised that the challenges posed by Brexit required close cooperation and a pragmatic approach from all sides, including the European Commission and the remaining 27 EU member states.

The discussions also touched upon the broader implications for British-Irish relations beyond the immediate economic and political challenges. Mrs. May and Mr. Kenny committed to maintaining the strong bilateral dialogue and collaboration that has characterised their nations' relationship in recent decades. They agreed on the necessity of ongoing engagement at all levels – political, official, and civil society – to address the complex issues arising from the UK’s decision to leave the EU. The shared aim, they concluded, was to forge a new partnership that respects the referendum result while preserving the peace, prosperity, and close ties that have defined the relationship between the UK, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland, ensuring that the progress achieved since the Good Friday Agreement is not undermined by future arrangements. This joint determination to seek a pragmatic and mutually beneficial outcome underscored the significance of Mrs. May's visit as a crucial early step in shaping the post-Brexit landscape for the island of Ireland and for Anglo-Irish relations.",1,0,False

If administrator KPMG cannot find buyers, the remaining stores will also shut. The chain employed 1,658 people.
The chain was sold to Greybull Capital last year by supermarket Morrisons, which has said it would offer jobs to ex-My Local staff.
It has struggled to compete in the cut-throat grocery sector, which is caught in a fierce price war.
My Local, formally known as Morrisons' M Local, was sold to Greybull for √Ç¬£25m in a deal fronted by retail veteran Mike Greene, who appeared on Channel 4 show The Secret Millionaire.
Earlier this month My Local said that administrators had been put on notice to take over running the business.
Last week Morrisons offered a lifeline to My Local staff, saying it wanted to offer them jobs in its supermarkets if there were store closures.
Mr Greene said: ""The last nine months has been one of the toughest retail trading periods that I have ever experienced and My Local has faced intense competition.
""The management team has been unable to return the business to profitability. For that I am truly sorry.""
Mark Orton, partner at KPMG and joint administrator, said: ""Management have faced tough trading conditions and despite their best efforts to improve performance, My Local was ultimately unable to return to viability.
""Although the majority of stores have now closed, we are in active discussions with a number of interested parties in relation to both the remaining 32 premises that are trading and a small number of those that have closed,"" he said.

Llama-4-Scout-17B,task2_sampling_20_80,2838,"Rehtaeh Parsons , 17 , of Nova Scotia , killed herself in April after being taunted over a photo of her alleged rape by four boys , her mother has said . Two 18 - year - old men were arrested on Thursday in connection with the photograph . The men , who have not been named , will be prosecuted in a juvenile court . "" We hope that today 's arrests help the community to heal , "" Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) Superintendent Roland Wells said at a press conference in Halifax on Thursday.

Superintendent Wells, who leads the Nova Scotia RCMP's support services, emphasized that the investigation is active and ongoing, urging anyone with further information to come forward. He thanked the public for their patience and assistance throughout the complex review process. The arrests mark a significant development in a case that has drawn national and international attention, sparking widespread outrage and a critical examination of Canada's laws regarding cyberbullying and the sharing of non-consensual intimate images.

The decision to make arrests followed an intensive re-examination of the case by the RCMP, initiated after the initial investigation by Halifax Regional Police had concluded without charges in February. This earlier outcome had been met with widespread condemnation from Rehtaeh's family, victim advocates, and the public, leading to a direct appeal to the Nova Scotia government for intervention. Premier Darrell Dexter had personally apologized to Rehtaeh’s mother, Leah Parsons, for the handling of the case and formally requested the RCMP to take over the investigation.

Leah Parsons has been a relentless advocate for justice for her daughter, using social media and media interviews to share Rehtaeh’s story and highlight the devastating consequences of online harassment. She has consistently called for stronger legal measures and a more compassionate approach from law enforcement and the justice system towards victims of sexual assault. Rehtaeh's story quickly became a symbol of the urgent need for action against online violence, triggering a national debate on consent, privacy, and the responsibilities of internet users and service providers.

The two individuals arrested face charges related to the distribution of an intimate image, which allegedly depicted Rehtaeh's sexual assault. Due to their age at the time of the alleged offense and the specifics of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, their names cannot be publicly disclosed. The prosecution in a juvenile court underscores the complexities of applying existing laws to new forms of digital crime.

The community in Nova Scotia, particularly in Halifax, has been deeply affected by Rehtaeh’s death, with numerous vigils, protests, and online campaigns demanding justice and systemic change. While the arrests bring a sense of relief to many, including Rehtaeh's family, the broader conversation about cyberbullying and supporting victims of sexual violence continues. The RCMP’s commitment to this ongoing investigation aims to provide closure for the family and reinforce that such acts will be pursued vigorously by law enforcement. This case has served as a stark reminder of the digital age's darker side and the collective responsibility to create a safer online environment.",1,0,False

The union claims removing guards compromises passenger safety and attacks a vital role.

RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said: 'Merseyrail’s announcement is a kick in the teeth for staff and public. Removing guards undermines safety and accessibility. We won't let Merseyrail put profits over people. Our members are resolute; we'll vigorously campaign to protect the guard's role and ensure safe services. This fight is about safety and security, especially in emergencies. Merseyrail left us no choice but to ballot.'

Merseyrail Managing Director John Tilley responded by stressing safety, stating new DOO trains use advanced technology like driver-monitored CCTV. He said: 'Safety is our priority. All permanent guards and guard managers will be redeployed into new customer service roles on platforms, with no pay loss or compulsory redundancies. This enhances customer service and aligns with modern UK rail practices. We urge RMT to engage constructively, avoiding disruptive industrial action that harms passengers and the local economy.'
