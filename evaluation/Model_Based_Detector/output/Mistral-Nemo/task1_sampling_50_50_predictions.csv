Mistral-Nemo,task1_sampling_50_50,122,"Previously unreleased archive footage brings together a vibrant tapestry of Ulster's past, showcasing events from Winston Churchill's notable Belfast visit in 1912 and a 1963 Viking re-enactment in a County Down coastal town, alongside stories of tourism, industrial legacy, and athletic endeavors. As part of a significant historical initiative called 'From Britain On Film', the British Film Institute (BFI) has made hundreds of previously unreleased films from its archives available for public online viewing at no cost. The collection chronicles royal tours and civic parades, including Churchill's 1912 speech at Belfast's Celtic Park, where he spoke to nationalists and endorsed Home Rule. Additionally, numerous travel films are featured, originally designed to promote Northern Ireland as a tourist destination to audiences in Great Britain and the United States, thereby boosting visitor numbers prior to the onset of the Troubles. The archive also highlights sporting events, such as the 1930 Ulster Tourist Trophy race, held at the Ards circuit in County Down, an event that drew thousands of onlookers and captivated the international motorsport community.

However, the most compelling material lies in the footage depicting everyday individuals engaged in remarkable activities. Scenes of workers in spinning mills and the construction of the M1 motorway at Stockman's Lane in Belfast showcase Northern Ireland's industrial peak. One film documents Northern Ireland's inaugural hosting of the World Ploughing Championships, where, appropriately, a local competitor claimed victory. This 1959 competition in Armoy, County Antrim, is preserved in colour footage, capturing Lawrence McMillan's triumphant moment as he secured the Golden Plough.

Yet, a 1938 recording from Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital proves arguably the most insightful. It offers an uncommon look into its casualty department and operating theatres as they operated a decade before the National Health Service was established. While medical practices have progressed significantly over the subsequent eighty years, certain aspects of healthcare in Northern Ireland seem to persist; the film concludes with the hospital's management board chairman appealing for reduced waiting lists.

Francis Jones of Northern Ireland Screen, responsible for collecting much of this material, stated that the project's goal was to safeguard fragile films that were at risk of deterioration or loss. He added that film possesses a unique nostalgic value, distinct from engaging with textbooks or history books. ""Witnessing the footage firsthand offers a visceral connection that truly resonates with viewers,"" he commented. The entire 'From Britain On Film' archive is accessible via the BFI Player.",1,0,False

Jointly funded by the Sheffield City Region Investment Fund and the University, the project is scheduled for completion by September, coinciding with the new academic year. Improvements will encompass public courtyards around the Arts Tower and Western Bank concourse, alongside the creation of a new public park near Broad Lane. Furthermore, additional pedestrian and cycle crossings will be established, and existing ones upgraded.

Keith Lilley, director of estates and facilities management, commented that the development would ""transform the campus environment and support the University's links with the city centre."" He expressed a desire for Sheffield residents to actively use the campus, whether for dining at its cafes, cycling through to Weston Park, or simply enjoying the newly created greener, safer spaces.

The University is providing £5.1 million for the work, complemented by £2.9 million from the Sheffield City Region Investment Fund. Leigh Bramall of Sheffield City Council highlighted that universities are ""critical to the future of Sheffield and vital to the successful economic growth of the city.""

Mistral-Nemo,task1_sampling_50_50,452,"Campaign group Liberty asserts that the extensive collection of electronic data by intelligence agencies, facilitated by certain powers, constitutes an ""assault on our freedom."" The Investigatory Powers Act (IPA), which grants these powers, received royal assent in November. The government has pledged to uphold this legislation.

Under the IPA, state agencies are authorized to control and alter electronic devices, access private communications like texts, online messages, and emails, and monitor phone calls, even without any suspicion of criminal activity. The act requires telecommunication firms to store metadata—including sender, location, and time—for calls, emails, texts, and web browsing, but explicitly not the content itself.

Liberty, however, seeks to legally contest the legitimacy of these powers and is publicly fundraising for a judicial review. Liberty director Martha Spurrier states that the government, last year, ""exploited fear and distraction to quietly create the most extreme surveillance regime of any democracy in history."" She added that ""hundreds of thousands"" have since called for its repeal, deeming it an ""unprecedented, unjustified assault on our freedom."" In November 2016, a petition advocating the act's repeal garnered over 118,000 signatures.

The Investigatory Powers Act, proposed by then-Home Secretary Theresa May, was approved by the House of Lords on November 19. Though the act's ""bulk powers"" are highly contentious, security services and the government maintain they are vital for counter-terrorism. Last month, demands arose for the government to revise the act after the European Court of Justice ruled ""general and indiscriminate"" retention of communications data unlawful. EU judges stipulated such data could only be retained for serious crime investigations. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman noted the government's strong commitment to defending the act, asserting it protects both privacy and security, received unprecedented parliamentary scrutiny, and secured cross-party support.",1,0,False

Stuart Jones missed a golden opportunity for Bala to equalize late on, heading wide after Nathan Burke's free-kick found him unmarked at the back post. The decisive return leg will be held at Vaduz's Rheinpark Stadion on Thursday, July 6th. The winners will then face either Ballymena United or Norwegian side Odd in the second qualifying round.

Bala manager Colin Caton shared his thoughts with BBC Wales Sport: ""I don't think we began the game particularly well; we were quite sluggish and overly cautious about knowing our opponents. Nevertheless, we still created good opportunities, including a clear penalty when Kieran [Smith] was pulled back after breaking through. Vaduz capitalized on their two first-half chances, which highlights the fine margins at this level. It's genuinely frustrating, as we had the better chances. If we can secure the first goal in the away leg, it's an away goal, and that will put them in a sticky situation. They seemed to be panicking towards the end here. It simply frustrates me that we performed so well, but at this level, you absolutely have to take your opportunities.""",1,0,False

News Corp is recognized as a major global media entity, owning newspapers such as The Times, The Sun, and The Wall Street Journal. News Corp and 21st Century Fox underwent a corporate split in 2013. The latter company's portfolio includes the US broadcaster Fox News and British Sky Broadcasting in the UK.

Rupert Murdoch, who recently finalized a notable divorce from Wendi Deng, described Lachlan as a ""talented executive"" possessing extensive business knowledge. Lachlan will be reporting directly to Chase Carey, who serves as 21st Century Fox's chief executive. Rupert expressed his pleasure regarding Lachlan's return to a leadership position, stating his son would collaborate closely with him, Chase, James, and the board to ensure future growth.

Mistral-Nemo,task1_sampling_50_50,1361,"Private Sean Benton was discovered deceased at the Deepcut barracks in Surrey in June 1995, having sustained five gunshot wounds while on guard duty at a perimeter fence. The human rights group Liberty stated that the Attorney General has granted his family permission to apply to the High Court, despite an earlier inquest having recorded a suicide verdict for the 20-year-old soldier.

Earlier this month, a second inquest, examining the death of Private Cheryl James – who also died at Deepcut in 1995 from a single gunshot wound – similarly returned a suicide verdict. Over 100 witnesses testified during the Cheryl James inquiry. In his ruling, Coroner Brian Barker QC strongly criticized Deepcut's welfare provisions, citing compelling evidence of a pervasive sexualized environment.

Representing Pte Benton's twin brother Tony and his sister Tracy Lewis, Liberty submitted an application to the Attorney General in July 2015, seeking to nullify the initial July 1995 inquest and demand a new investigation. Liberty stated that since Pte Benton's death, numerous individuals have informed his family and publicly asserted their belief that he, originally from Hastings, East Sussex, endured physical and psychological bullying at the barracks.

Ms Lewis expressed being ""overwhelmed and disturbed by all the details of the shameful environment at Deepcut which have finally come to light through the Cheryl James inquest – it is terrible to think of Sean alone there."" She added that over two decades after their brother's passing, and having recently lost both parents, she and Tony are ""determined to find out what happened to Sean.""

Pte Benton was the initial casualty among four young recruits who succumbed to gunshot wounds at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. Liberty highlighted that the first inquest, held merely a month after his death, involved testimony from only six individuals. Crucially, Pte Benton's medical and mental health records were not procured, nor was any evidence gathered or presented regarding his experiences at the barracks. Emma Norton, a lawyer for Liberty, asserted that a proper and independent investigation into Pte Benton's death in 1995 could have spared his family decades of suffering and unresolved questions.",1,1,True

While snow was predicted mainly for higher elevations, more intense showers might occasionally bring it down to lower levels.

Among the areas experiencing significant snowfall was the Cairngorms region.

The 31-year-old, who was on holiday with her boyfriend, Andrei Burnaz, had remained hospitalized since the incident. It later came to light that Mr. Burnaz had planned to propose to her on their outing.

Her family, in a statement, confirmed the architect's death on Thursday. They shared their profound grief, stating that after a two-week struggle for survival, their ""beloved and irreplaceable Andreea – wonderful daughter, sister, partner, dedicated friend and the most unique and life loving person you can imagine – was cruelly and brutally ripped away from our lives in the most heartless and spiritless way."" They added, ""She will always be remembered as our shining ray of light that will forever keep on shining in our hearts.""

The family also expressed immense gratitude to the medical team for their ""never-ending dedication,"" stating they were ""deeply touched and eternally grateful"" and that their ""kindness and empathy are beyond compare."" They concluded by saying, ""There are no words to even begin to describe the crushing pain and emptiness that is left in our hearts.""

Mr. Burnaz, who himself sustained a broken foot during the assault, recently returned to Westminster Bridge to place a single white rose in remembrance. According to Romania's UK ambassador, Dan Mihalache, who spoke to the BBC, the couple were in London for Mr. Burnaz's birthday, and he had intended to propose. Mihalache further explained that it is believed Masood's vehicle struck Mr. Burnaz after mounting the pavement, subsequently forcing Ms. Cristea into the River Thames.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan conveyed his deep sorrow over Andreea Cristea's passing, tweeting that ""Londoners hold her & her loved ones in our thoughts today.""

The attack also claimed the lives of Aysha Frade, 44, a London sixth-form college employee; US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, from Utah; and Leslie Rhodes, 75, a retired window cleaner from south London. Additionally, PC Keith Palmer, a father of two, was fatally stabbed outside Parliament.

Mistral-Nemo,task1_sampling_50_50,2428,"During his Open Championship debut at Royal Birkdale, 38-year-old Manley briefly held the lead, achieving a two-under-par score despite the challenging weather. A pleased Manley conveyed to BBC Radio Wales that he had initially considered par to be a respectable outcome for his first attempt. He concluded his round impressively, scoring an eagle three on the par-five 17th and a birdie on the final hole. Manley remarked that ending the round a couple of strokes under par felt 'great'. This strong finish marked a significant recovery from a nervous beginning, where he lost a stroke on the first hole after his opening drive at one of golf's major tournaments landed in the rough. He described feeling extremely anxious on the first tee, admitting he was 'shaking a little bit' due to the 'horrific' weather. He also mentioned difficulties warming up and a lack of rhythm while wearing his waterproof gear. Manley confessed it was likely the 'most nervous' he had ever been for a tee shot, but expressed optimism about understanding what to anticipate for the next day, hinting at a 'better game plan'. Manley, a professional golfer since 2003 and the sole Welsh competitor at Royal Birkdale, enjoyed considerable support from spectators. He noted the presence of friends from his local golf club, Mountain Ash, and his family, making his good score particularly satisfying for them. He admitted the achievement hadn't fully 'sunk in' yet, suggesting it might become real once he watched some golf later that evening, but confirmed he felt 'pretty chuffed'. Ranked 520th globally, Manley is scheduled to begin his second round on Friday at 11:47 BST. Despite his strong start, he is not adjusting his objectives for the week. He emphasized the need to 'plot your way around the course' due to the demanding links, stating he wouldn't allow his mind to 'wander'.",1,0,False

Mistral-Nemo,task1_sampling_50_50,2452,"Two charities, Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, have highlighted the dangers associated with relocating patients great distances from their homes. This caution coincides with the imminent release of findings from a serious case review concerning patient abuse at a private facility located close to Bristol. The BBC Panorama programme brought this abuse to light through covert filming. Eleven individuals have pleaded guilty to charges of neglect and mistreatment linked to the incidents. The South Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults Board (SAB) commissioned an independent expert to conduct this review.

Since the Panorama broadcast in May of the previous year, Mencap and the Challenging Behaviour Foundation have received 260 reports from families detailing abuse and neglect within institutional care settings. Their collaborative report, titled 'Out of Sight', documented numerous severe incidents reported by families, encompassing physical and sexual assault, along with excessive use of restraint.

Mark Goldring, Mencap's chief executive, expressed concern, stating that without a robust government plan to shut down large care facilities and establish suitable local services for individuals with learning disabilities, another scandal akin to Winterbourne View is highly probable. The charities indicated that hundreds of people with learning disabilities are presently housed in assessment and treatment units similar to Winterbourne View. They highlighted that many of these facilities are situated far from patients' homes, increasing their vulnerability to neglect and abuse.

Vivien Cooper, who founded the Challenging Behaviour Foundation, voiced profound worries regarding patient safety and well-being. She elaborated that ""hundreds of individuals with learning disabilities are being placed in distant care institutions, often for years unnecessarily, leaving them susceptible to neglect and abuse.""

A spokesperson for the Department of Health affirmed their stance: individuals should, whenever feasible, receive support to reside in their own homes within their local communities. While acknowledging that a limited number of cases may necessitate high-quality assessment and treatment services, potentially involving brief inpatient stays, they stressed that this should not replace excellent community-based care. The spokesperson underlined the critical importance of properly commissioning and regularly reviewing all services, ensuring they are not employed as permanent solutions.

Subsequent to the BBC investigation, twenty-four patients were moved from the Castlebeck-operated Winterbourne View hospital, located near Hambrook. The facility closed the subsequent month. The criminal charges specifically pertained to five patients from the hospital, and all those charged are currently awaiting their sentences.",1,0,False

Mistral-Nemo,task1_sampling_50_50,2919,"Reports indicate West Ham intends to increase their bid for the striker, who began his career at the east London club. At 34, Defoe has been a key player for Premier League strugglers Sunderland this season, scoring 11 goals in 21 appearances. His latest contributions came on Monday, helping Sunderland twice recover from a deficit to draw 2-2 with in-form Liverpool, a result that leaves manager David Moyes's side in 18th place.

Defoe's senior career started at West Ham before a £7 million move to rivals Tottenham in 2004, a deal that saw Bobby Zamora transfer the other way. He then joined Portsmouth for £7.5 million in January 2008, only to return to Spurs for £15 million the following year. A surprising move to Canadian team Toronto FC followed in 2014, until former Black Cats manager and ex-Spurs teammate Gus Poyet brought him to Sunderland in 2015.

BBC Radio 5 live's chief football correspondent, Ian Dennis, suggests West Ham will indeed test Sunderland's resolve again. However, it's considered inconceivable for the Black Cats to sell Defoe given their vulnerable league position. David Moyes recently described Defoe as ""priceless,"" stressing that his goal-scoring ability will determine their top-flight survival. The rarity of proven, high-calibre goalscorers is precisely why West Ham is pursuing the 34-year-old. While money often influences decisions, Defoe's value to Sunderland's Premier League campaign is truly unparalleled.",1,1,True
